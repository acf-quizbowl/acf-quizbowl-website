Rules for Invitational Play</H1></CENTER>

<H2>Matches</H2>

Each game will consist of 20 tossups and 20 bonus questions. Ties will be
broken by reading extra tossups until one team earns a penalty or correctly
answers a tossup. At ACF Nationals, ties will be decided by sets of three
toss-ups.

<H2>Toss-up play</H2>

<H3>Time limits</H3>
5 seconds after question is completed to ring in.<BR>
5 seconds to answer after the buzzer sounds from ringing in.

<H3>Points</H3>
The team that answers a toss-up correctly is awarded 10 points.<P>

<H3>Penalties</H3>
There will be a 5 point penalty assessed on any player who buzzes in before
the question is completely read with an incorrect answer. This penalty
applies only to the first team to ring in on a given tossup.<P>
The penalty will apply if the reader has not completed the absolute last
word on the paper. If the reader is in the middle of the last word, it is
reader judgment whether to assess a penalty.

<H3>Consultation</H3>
Absolutely no consultation will be allowed during tossups. Consultation
includes verbal and non-verbal communication. Consultation will be treated
as an incorrect answer and if it occurs before a question if complete, a
5 point penalty will be assessed. If you answer when you have not rung in,
you will be called for consultation, ruled incorrect, given a 5 point
penalty if appropriate, and the question will be finished for the other team.<P>
A player who buzzed in may answer with or without being recognized by the
reader. No player who has buzzed in will be called for consultation.<P>
If it is necessary to use a buzzer system that does not have lights, either
team may at any time request to see the display panel showing which player
rang in.

<H3>Clarification</H3>
In the event the reader does not clearly understand an answer, the player
may be prompted to repeat the answer. If the reader is still unclear, the
player may be asked to spell the answer in order to clarify an unclear
pronunciation. Please note! It is not necessary for the player to spell the
answer correctly to be awarded the question. For example, a player may be
asked to spell "Manet" or "Monet" to differentiate between the two
Impressionists. The moderator is only interested in the second letter of the
word. Spelling <EM>M-A-N-A-Y</EM> is acceptable for "Manet."

The reader will prompt for more information if a player gives part of an
underlined answer. If the reader fails to do so, a team may protest.<P>

The same clarification rules apply to bonus questions.

<H3>Answering</H3>
The answer is the stream of verbal information given by the player either
before the five second time limit expires and that information given past
the time limit that is a continuation of an answer already begun.<P>
No answer may be a list of a class of answers. For example, a player may not
ring in and list all the chemical elements in response to a question that
begins "This chemical element...".<P>

In all ACF competitions, any two or three pieces of linked information may
be given as an answer. In all cases, such information must be correct.<P>

If the desired answer is included in the three answers, then the answer
should be accepted. Such answers include, but are not restricted to:<P>

<P>
What follows is an explanation of the blitz rule. While blitzing is allowed
in official ACF events, the fact that the questions are well-edited will
render it unnecessary in 98 plus percent of all tossups. In the interest of
rewarding knowledge first, blitzing will continue to be allowed. PLEASE do
not get overly worked up over it or confused by it. If you don't understand
what is allowed, then simply stick to the above type examples and you'll be
fine. If you see a blitz, it will be a rare bird. You may, for all
practical purposes, ignore this section if it will make you feel better.<P>

Blitzes including more than three pieces of information are allowed. An
example of an acceptable blitz is as follows. For a question that began:<P>

<EM>On April 6, 1862....</EM><P>

You can buzz in and say: "Grant defeated Johnston at the Battle of Shiloh
or Pittsburgh Landing in Tennessee."<P>

This illustrates a subtlety of blitzing that is hard to put into words.
Though there are TWO generals (seemingly the same class of answer) listed
in the blitz, they are linked by the battle of Shiloh and that link is
specified in the blitz. This is not equivalent to buzzing in and naming
random Civil War generals.<P>

<H2>Bonus play</H2>
At the beginning of play, a single player on each team must be selected to
give the team's answer to bonus questions to the reader. That player is
the only player that may give bonus answers unless the reader is notified
verbally that another player will give the answer.<P>

<H3>Time limits</H3>
5 seconds per part on a multi-part bonus.<BR>
15 seconds on a list bonus.<BR>
25 seconds per part unless otherwise specified on a calculation bonus.<P>

At the end of the allotted time period, the reader will request an answer.
An answer or a designation must occur immediately upon the reader's
prompting for an answer. A designation must be short and specific at the
discretion of the reader.<P>

All answers to bonus questions, especially on lists, must be continuous.
A pause stops your answer.<P>

All bonuses are to be 30 points. If your team receives a bonus valued at
less, you may request a replacement. If you choose to keep the lesser-valued
bonus at the time of play, it will stand. A request for a replacement must
be made at the time it becomes apparent that the bonus is not 30 points in
value.<P>

All bonuses must also contain multiple parts. Any single part bonus will
not be read.<P>

It should be the general policy of readers to provide bonus answers only at
the end of a bonus. In the event of a follow-up question that requires
knowledge of the first answer, the reader is allowed to give that
infomation to the team receiving the bonus.<P>

<H3>Reader error</H3>
In the event that a reader mistakenly reveals the answer to a tossup before
either team has rung in, the tossup will be replaced with the 21st in the
packet.<P>

If the reader reveals the answer to a tossup after one team has madea -5
or given an incorrect answer but before the other team has had a chance
to ring in, the second team will receive a replacement tossup read only to
that team.<P>

If the reader makes an error on a bonus part, the tournament director will
replace it with an equally valued bonus part. In the event that the bonus
was a 30-20-10, a new question will be substituted in its place.<P>

<H2>Protests</H2>
<H3>What is protestable?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>That the answer on the paper is wrong.
<LI>That the answer a player has given is equivalent to the answer on the
paper or that excessive underlining has been made.<P>
If a reader prompts you for more information when you have given a
reasonably unique answer and you are prompted for more information and
can't give it, you may protest on the grounds that your answer is
equivalently as correct as the answer on the paper.
<LI>That a question has two conflicting pieces of uniquely identifying
information.
<LI>That the reader has made an error in play of the question. If a judgment
call is protested, the Tournament director will overrule the protest in
most cases.
</UL>

<H3>Readers run amok</H3>

In the rare event of a reader run amok, i.e. one who accepts George
Washington for William Shakespeare, the reader can be overruled by the
Tournament Director, but on judgment calls the reader's decision is the
final arbiter.<P>

<H3>Lodging protests</H3>
Protests for either tossups or bonuses must be lodged before the end of the
half and can be lodged by any player involved in the game or the team
coach. Players and/or coaches from other teams may not lodge protests.<P>

<H3>Resolving protests</H3>
Protests will not be resolved unless they affect the outcome of the match.
This will be determined by removing all penalties, awarded tossup points,
and bonus points for the question under protests. The MAXIMUM possible
scoring will be assumed for the team lodging the protests and if upheld,
that team will receive a chance at the same number of points they would
have received had their correct answer been accepted.<P>
If there are two conflicting pieces of uniquely identifying information
within the question, there are two possible outcomes in terms of protest
resolution.<P>
This is best explained by example. Consider the following question:<P>

<EM>After getting his Ph.D., he won the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physics for his
work on the photoelectric effect...</EM><P>
Answer on paper: Albert _Einstein_<P>

<STRONG>Case 1:</STRONG><BR>

Team A buzzes in after the word physics and says "DeBroglie" and is ruled
wrong. In this event, team A may protest that they gave an answer that was
uniquely identified and be awarded the points. This will occur even if
team B gives the answer Einstein after the entire question is read.<P>

<STRONG>Case 2:</STRONG><BR>
The two conflicting pieces of information are given before a player on
either team rings in. In this instance, a team may protest and have the
question thrown out.

<H3>Deciding protests</H3>
If the opposing team will concede a protest, the matter can be resolved on
the spot. Please be good sports and concede if you know the other team is
right. You WILL lose the protest if they are correct and waste the time of
everyone in the tournament.<P>
If the protest cannot be resolved in the room where the match is being
played, it will be referred to the Tournament Director, who may, in the
event of corroborating information fount in a reference book or via experts
on the subject, rule in the protesting team's favor. At ACF Nationals,
this role will be played by a group of three experienced tournament
directors or moderators.<P>
All Tournament Directors are expected to attempt to verify errors but will
only have a limited number of reference books on hand. In the event that
the TD cannot find documentation or experts to support a protest, it will
be up to the protesting team to provide documentation to the satisfaction
of the tournament officials.<P>

<H2>Behavior</H2>
If a player gets unruly, the reader may issue a warning. If the improper
behavior persists, the reader may eject the player only AFTER consulting
with the tournament director. Any player who is ejected from a game will
be considered "warned" for the remainder of the tournament, and can be
expelled without warning for continued similar behavior. Once again, the
reader must consult with the tournament director before ejecting a player.<P>
Readers may not award penalties, declare a team ineligible for a tossup or
in any way attempt to penalize a team via score for improper behavior of
a player!  However, making a reader angry may result in less generous rulings
that cannot be protested, so treat the readers with respect.<P>

<H3>What is improper behavior?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Continuing to argue with a reader after a protest has been lodged. Once you
have lodged a protest, shut up. It will be resolved later anyway.
<LI>Deliberately making noise to disrupt the play of the game or the bonus play
of your opposing team.
</UL>
Cussing, beating your head on the table, or in general being expressive or
even downright rude is <STRONG>not</STRONG> grounds for ejection unless it make continued
game play impossible. ACF does not, however, encourage unsportsmanlike
behavior.
Coaches are also included in these rules and improper behavior on the
part of a coach also includes signalling players about question information
during play. Coaches may signal players about score and play without
penalty.<P>
Observers, including team alternates, spouses, friends, enemies, etc.
have no rights and can be summarily expelled from any room by any reader
who deems their behavior disruptive.

<H2>The Prime Directive</H2>
Tournament directors should make decisions not covered in these rules giving
first priority to rewarding the player with knowledge and the team that
deserves points. Expedience and convenience of the tournament director
should be considered secondary to the interest of the players and teams.

<H2>The Infallibility of Tournament Directors</H2>
The decisions of the tournament director or his designees are considered
final and are not protestable.<P>
