There is no minimum entry fee.  We are also pleased to announce that this year
TEAMS FROM OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL TIME ZONE WILL PLAY FOR FREE! Teams wishing

any discount carriers at this time;  we may be able to transport teams to and
from the airports at Kansas City or Oklahoma City with enough notice. The only
condition to this offer is the submission of a question packet by 2/25--otherwise
 teams outside the central time zone will be charged a $25 entry
fee.<P>

For teams in the central time zone, note that the submission of a question
packet is not required, but if you choose to submit a packet it must be
received by February 25.<P>

at least a full round robin.  The tournament will be scheduled to end at around
6:00.<P>

I look forward to seeing everybody on March 14.<P>
