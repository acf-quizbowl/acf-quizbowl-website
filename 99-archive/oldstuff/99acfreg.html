<H1>1999 ACF Regionals Announcement</H1>
</CENTER>
As with ACF Nationals, this will be a tournament run using the old ACF format and
 rules, and intended to carry on the spirit and style of ACF Regionals, but is not run
 by any incorporated organization.<P>

The tournament will be held on the Friday and Saturday, February 26-27, 1999. 
If there is a need, one or more of the multiple tournaments can possibly be moved to 
another weekend.  Schools should inform me of such a need.<P>

The following are the host sites:<P>

These contacts are the individual tournament hosts; Direct to 
<A HREF="dhamiltn@wam.umd.edu">David Hamilton</A> any questions of a more general nature.<P>

Only one team per school must submit a packet. The team that submits a packet should
ideally be the first, or most experienced team, from the school, and the packet should 
clearly indicate both the team name and list of players who contributed to the packet.<P>

Although each region will have its own breakdown of fees, please note that every school
which plans to play must have one team submit a packet by January 31, 1999. This is
the <STRONG>absolute</STRONG> late deadline for all packets.<P>

When writing your packet, you should follow the same style and distribution as for ACF 
Nationals, but adjust the difficulty accordingly, keeping in mind that the median team 
at most Regionals is not as strong as the median team at Nationals.  The Writing Guide 
is located <A HREF="writers.html">here</A>. Send your packet to dhamiltn@wam.umd.edu. 
Please follow the formatting guidelines available <A HREF="formatting.html">
here</A>. <STRONG>Failure to follow the formatting guidelines will result in your packet
being sent back</STRONG>. It will not be considered to have been officialy received and eligible
for discounts until has been formatted correctly and fulfills the
distribution requirements.<P>

Questions may be sent as (in order of preference)<BR><OL>
<LI>A Microsoft Word file attached to email or disk
<LI>An RTF file
<LI>Some other PC format which preserves emboldening (Works, Wordperfect, etc.)<br>
Please send all of the above in 10 point Times New Roman with necessary parts of answers
in <STRONG>bold</STRONG>.
<LI>Plain text (much less preferable than above)<BR>
For plain text, _underscore_ all essential parts of answers, but <STRONG>do not</STRONG>
capitalize them.</OL><P>

If you really want to send your questions by disk (which seems pretty retarded to me),
my mailing address is:<P>

1303A Calvert Hall<BR>
University of Maryland, College Park<BR>
College Park, MD 20742
