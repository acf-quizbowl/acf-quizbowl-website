ACF stands for Academic Competition Federation, a loosely centralized
non-incorporated, non-profit organization dedicated to providing low-cost,
high-quality academic quiz tournaments.<P>

The Federation was started in the summer of 1997 upon the dissolution of a
previous organization with the same initials, the Academic Competition
Foundation, which sponsored a National championship tournament and a
nationwide set of Regional tournaments each year from 1991-1997.  The new
ACF has adopted these orphaned tournaments and will be running them this
year under the editorship of John Edwards, Rick Grimes, and Dave Hamilton
(see <A HREF="announcements.html">Announcements</A> on this web site).<P>

ACF is headed by John Sheahan, Andrew Yaphe, and David Hamilton.<P>
