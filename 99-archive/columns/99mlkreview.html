<CENTER><H1>A Review of Georgia Tech's MLK</H1></CENTER>

Many thanks to Carol Guthrie and the usual band of Georgia Tech alumni
moderators for running yet another fine MLK tournament this year.  Carol
did a nice job of editing on such short notice; repeats were few and
far-between, with no repeated clues that I can remember.  With the
exception of two wickedly difficult packets, the questions were pitched at
a fairly enjoyable level, with most of the teams in the field averaging
over 200 per game.<P>

As usual, the field was ridiculously strong.  Maryland and Chicago both
brought under-strength, but still formidable teams to the tournament --
Maryland with Zeke Berdichevsky and former Emory all-star Christine Moritz
filling in for Michael Starsinic and Willie Keller, and Chicago playing
with only three players: Andrew, Alice Chou and Peter Braxton.  South
Carolina boasted a tossup machine in the duo of TC Ford and Adam Humphries.
Kentucky's ever-improving Seth Kendall also got good support this time,
with Kelly averaging almost 30.  Jason King, the captain of the 96 Georgia
Tech champion team, was back, this time on Georgia, and still had much of
the knowledge that made him scary two years ago.  On top of all this,
Patrick Brannon, Jim Dendy, Mike Musgrove, and Don Windham decided to
terrorize the field on an exhibition team.  They lost only to Chicago, by
80 points.<P>

The most anticipated clash, Chicago vs. Maryland, was scheduled for the 6th
round, on Cornell's packet.  It went Chicago's way, with Andrew Yaphe
answering six tossups after being down 170-25 after eight, to win 305-200.
Maryland answered 1 tossup in the second half.  Chicago was thus in
position to win the tournament if they won out (Tech abandoned the more
recent ACF win-by-two custom in favor of an old-fashioned straight
round-robin, with a final game in case of two tied records).  But they
dropped two games, to Cornell and Georgia, while Maryland buckled down and
won out, claiming the tournament for the first time since 1994.<P>

Jason King (51.4 ppg) and I (54.6) were the third and second scorers
respectively, and we played a heck of a game on a packet by Seth Kendall.
I answered 8 of the first 10 tossups to go up 245-40, then watched as
Jason, who had answered the other two in the first half, nailed seven in
the second to go up 255-235 after 19 questions.  I got Cleopatra, and
Cornell needed 15 points to win.  The bonus was a 10-10-10 on Asian
revolutionary groups with colorful names.  We got the Blue Shirts for 10,
but couldn't come up with the Red Guards, and the game was tied.  I could
only watch as Jason answered the sudden death tossup on Sir Humphrey Davy;
"Colvin science" wasn't good enough.  As disappointing as an overtime loss
is, I had to smile at the way we had played that game, both of us 9-1 in
regulation.  I tip my hat to Jason, always a gentleman as an opponent, and
a player I count myself very lucky to have run even with him for 20 tossups.<P>

Cornell's performance was much better than I could have hoped for, despite
going 1-2 in games decided on tossup 20 or in sudden death.  A few weeks of
practice with my former teammates in College Park during the first two
weeks of January proved to be just the right medicine for amnesia induced
by 8 months of attempted retirement.  And a little practice with Flash'Em
didn't hurt any either.<P>

This was a tournament in which the neg-5 artists among us cleaned up our
collective act.  Dave Hamilton was almost 7-to-1 in the black, and at
4-to-1, I was far better than my wretched career ratio.  Renouned South
Carolina negger TC Ford was at 6.5-to-1.  Sharp-shooting Seth Kendall led
the top 20 in ratio at 14-to-1.<P>

What can this tournament tell us about the likely outcome of ACF Nationals?
Well, its predictive power is somewhat impaired by the understrength squads
brought by the top teams.<P>

This much is clear, however: if Jeff Johnson doesn't play this year (or
perhaps even if he does), Andrew Yaphe is the best player on the circuit,
answering almost half the questions in every game.  Chicago's wins over
both Maryland and the exhibition team mark them as one of the top two teams
at Nationals.<P>

The other top team would be Maryland -- and I will refrain from picking one
over the other for now (The ACF Nostradamus tells me he will make Regionals
predictions in about 3 weeks).  The fact that Maryland captain Dave
Hamilton averaged almost 50 despite playing with the highest scoring trio
of teammates in the tournament speaks volumes about his skills.  He was
unquestionably the second-best player in the tournament, and I don't think
anyone -- Andrew Yaphe included -- doubts that Maryland will be the deepest
foursome at Nationals.  Despite their loss to Chicago, they recorded some
very impressive numbers, and their utter demolition of even excellent
opponents is eerily reminiscent of some past ACF Nationals champions -- I'm
thinking especially of the '94 Chicago and '96 Tech teams.  At the
beginning of round 4, eventual 3rd place team South Carolina filed into the
room to play Cornell, and I asked them how they were doing.  Adam replied
that they were just coming off a 605-90 shellacking at the hands of
Maryland, in which they had been held to just two tossups.<P>

South Carolina also deserves props for a very creditable performance.
Thanks to their fearsome knowledge of leadin clues, they are a threat to
beat anyone they play -- and with the exception of TC, who is, I think, a
senior, this team is young.  I had one of my best games against them, but
still gox waxed, 335-155.  They also wrote a very nice packet, and I can't
wait to attend their tournament on the third weekend of March.<P>

After the tournament, Carol read the round reserved for any possible
playoff game.  Maryland played against a team of Don Windham, Andrew Yaphe,
Albert Whited, and Jason King.  Don's team won, 360-180.  Don was 4-1,
Andrew 5-0, Albert 1-1, and Jason 2-0.  For Maryland, Zeke was 1-0, Julie
1-0, Dave 4-0, and Christine 0-2.<P>

It was a delight to see so many players present who have had interesting
careers, or who are embarking on promising ones ahead of them.  Mike
Musgrove especially has been an inspiration to me, and not just because he
is the king of list-memorizers.  I will always remember the look of
disappointment on his face as he slumped in the hallway at College Park
when Tech lost in the double-elim playoffs of 1994 ACF Nationals, after
beating Chicago to go undefeated in the prelims -- but this image is always
accompanied by the grin he wore in Knoxville after Tech's 1996 vindication
in the finals.<P>

Among the young 'uns, South Carolina's Adam Humphreys was a standout.  I'm
told that he is a sophomore.  I was privileged to play alongside Darren
Abernethy, a high school junior from Milton in Georgia, who turned in a
creditable 15 ppg.  He's considering Princeton and Cornell, so I figured
I'd try to lure him in early. (Is this a recruiting violation?)<P>

The readers were quite good, especially Albert Whited, who kindly regaled
the Maryland and Chicago teams with quiz bowl stories both antiquated and
salacious while we ate Indian food after the tournament.  Thank you, Carol
Guthrie and Georgia Tech, for another memorable MLK weekend.<P>
