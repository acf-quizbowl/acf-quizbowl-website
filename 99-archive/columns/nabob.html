<EM>Head hung in shame, the lowly Matt enters the confessional and prepares to
tell his sins.</EM><P>

Father?<P>

<EM>Yes, my pitiful child, I hear you.</EM><P>

I'm the Lord of the Neg-Five.<P>

<EM>So pleased to meet you.</EM><P>

No one else can touch me, for three reasons: (1) I am the most reckless
player on the circuit; (2) I am the most forgetful player on the circuit;
and (3) I have heard most of the answers that come up, and therefore think
(wrongly) that I know them.<P>

<EM>Well, you do have some impressive qualifications there.  Can you provide
some examples?</EM><P>

NC State's Wesselmania might have been the first tournament to hand out
prizes for leaders in the category of interrupts.  Unfortunately, I have
always been on a fairly balanced team.  My sophomore year, Jonathan Rowell
took 18 negs in the last game of the tournament.  Had he not done that, I
would have nipped Bobby Shepard for the title.<P>

<EM>Oh, poor baby.</EM><P>

Two years later, I had honed my negging skills to an unapproachable level.
At the 97 Philly Experiment, I led the field in -5's, even against
impressive neggers like John Edwards, David Goodman, and Andrew Yaphe.<P>

<EM>You'd better watch that word "negger."  Some of these people might be
offended at such a label.</EM><P>

I can neg any way you like.  <A HREF="http://www.inform.umd.edu/Student/Campus_Activities/StudentOrg/maqt/maqt/retlex.html#bakerism">Bakerisms</A>? 
I've got 'em: "Dang, it's that third president of the United States!"<P>

<EM>That's nothing but a memory lapse.  Happens to the best of us.</EM><P>

You want obscenely wrong answers?  Take this one from the 96 Tennessee
Invitational:  "After the oral stage?  That would be the 'anal retentive'
stage."<P>

<EM>Hmm.  Somewhat distasteful.  But still, an honest mistake, not betokening
any extraordinary neg-itude.</EM><P>

It's the mark of a bad player to think that every question is going to be
about his own major.  I took my very first neg ever as a freshman at JMU's
tournament.  The question went: "In the Aeneid, Juno offers a nymph..."
<STRONG>BUZZ</STRONG> "Deiopeia!"  Never mind that the name of the nymph is not a likely
answer even at Tennessee Masters, let alone at the tournament that brought
us questions on South Carolina moped laws.  I'm a classicist.  I've read
the Aeneid.  So the question should obviously be asking for what only I
know, right?<P>

<EM>A little egocentrism.  Come on, you can do better that this.  The world's
greatest negger ought to be capable of extraordinary feats of 
<A HREF="http://www.inform.umd.edu/Student/Campus_Activities/StudentOrg/maqt/maqt/lexicon.html#biscuitry">biscuitry</A>.</EM><P>

Does abject stupidity strike your fancy?  At the 95 Emory Juniorbird, I
negged twice against Georgia Tech B.  The first was on a Michelangelo
question.  I said "Caravaggio."  The second was on a Correggio question in
the same packet.  I said "Caravaggio."  That's right: I negged twice with
the same wrong answer in the same game.  Tech was laughing about that one
in the hallway afterwards. <EM>Editor's note: see <A HREF="http://www.inform.umd.edu/Student/Campus_Activities/StudentOrg/maqt/maqt/lexicon.html#persistence">Persistence Neg</A>.</EM><P>

<EM>And rightly so.</EM><P>

Or do you want lots of negs?  I've had 8 in a game.<P>

<EM>I'm sure your teammates were just thrilled.</EM><P>

A bad ratio?  I spent my freshman year at a little over 2.6:1.<P>

<EM>Yes, but you were young, my boy.</EM><P>

My career is consistent.  I have 743 negs in 609 games over five years of
college play.  If you count three years of high school and two of middle
school, plus summers (it's easy to get negs at a Masters tournament!) I
probably have well over 1000 negs.<P>

<EM>But what are they like?  If half of them were hoses, it wouldn't be so
impressive.</EM><P>

It's quality you want?  Take this example: the tossup read, "His theology
has been compared to chewing bubblegum studded with broken glass--" <STRONG>BUZZ</STRONG>
 "That's John Barth, copied straight from 'An Incomplete Education.'"  And
me a Missousi Synod Lutheran!<P>

<EM>I'm speechless.  Old Karl must be turning over in his grave to think that
one of his flock is in a confessional right now.</EM><P>

So there you have it, folks.  It's an odd form of chest-beating, I know.
But I hereby assert my claim to be the maestro of the minus-five.<P>

<EM>It's not that I haven't tried to help you, son.  I prayed for you, and the
Lord gave you six straight games without a neg at Princeton last year.</EM><P>

I know, Father.  But I squandered it with 2 negs a game for the remainder
of the tournament.  The spirit is willing, but the buzzer finger is weak.<P>

<EM>Your penance is to memorize those old practice notes you haven't gotten
around to yet.  And finish writing that packet for Georgia Tech MLK.  You
are shriven.  Now go and sin no more.</EM><P>
