# Part 1: Introduction
As quizbowl moves online, good moderators remain critically important for running successful tournaments. Online tournaments take longer and are more logistically complex than in-person tournaments. To improve the experience for players and staffers alike, we created this guide to help moderators adapt to online tournaments – specifically, ACF’s online tournaments. Prepared and knowledgeable moderators are vital to fair, efficient, and enjoyable tournaments.

Quizbowl’s shift to online tournaments is a major undertaking. This training is designed to produce strong moderators to help online tournaments run smoothly.

## Who is this guide for?
This guide assumes you already have some experience with quizbowl and moderating quizbowl in person, so it doesn’t cover the basics. It is most useful to people looking to improve their existing moderating skills to prepare for online tournaments.

This guide is not meant to be an introduction for people with zero experience with quizbowl or moderating quizbowl tournaments. However, you may still find this training helpful. Keep in mind that first-time staff usually start out scorekeeping instead of moderating. If you would like to help staff a quizbowl tournament, but feel like you do not have enough experience to moderate, reach out to the TD and ask how else you can contribute.

Moderators for ACF’s online tournaments are expected to complete this training. Other guides or training modules are not acceptable substitutes.

## Pre-training resources
Before completing this training, or after completing this training but before moderating, you should:
- Familiarize yourself with the rules for the tournament, even if you’re experienced. New online-specific gameplay rules for both ACF and PACE have significant differences from both the standard gameplay rules and from the informal way online tournaments have historically been played.
    - [ACF gameplay rules](/gameplay-rules)
    - [Appendix to ACF rules for online tournaments](/gameplay-rules/#appendix-1-online-play)
    - [PACE gameplay rules](http://www.pace-nsc.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/191027_PACE_ruleset.pdf)
    - [PACE addendum for online tournaments](http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/players/online-tournament-rules/)

- [Test the audio/visual quality of your technology](#appendix-a-testing-your-setup) and your setup (e.g., are you in a place with significant ambient noise? Can your computer simultaneously open packets and open a videoconferencing program?).

- Familiarize yourself with community guides for your particular software platform:
    - [Zoom](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=24071)
    - [Discord](http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/staffers/discord-basics-for-online-tournaments/)

## Training overview
Spaced throughout this training are 9 quiz questions (including within the Quiz section) to test your understanding of the training material and also of standard quizbowl rules and procedures.

The quiz is not timed; you can pause and come back to it as necessary. However, we ask that you read closely and try to remain engaged throughout. Taking this training seriously will improve the experience for yourself, the other staffers, and players at your next online tournament.

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 1:</b> Which option describes your past moderating experience?</p>

</ol>
</div>


# Part 2: Ruleset overview
Before the day of the tournament, staffers should make sure they are familiar with their tournament’s governing rules. Rulesets are available online for [ACF-style](/gameplay-rules/) and [PACE-style](http://www.pace-nsc.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/191027_PACE_ruleset.pdf) tournaments. PACE also has a supplementary set of [rules for online tournaments](http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/players/online-tournament-rules/), and ACF’s ruleset has an [appendix for online tournaments](https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/#appendix-1-online-play). 

# Part 3: General moderating advice
## Controlling the room
- As the moderator, you are the official decision-maker for the match and your decisions should be respected. You are responsible for controlling the pace of the game and promoting an atmosphere of professionalism and respect for everyone. You should project confidence and authority to the best of your ability. You can always ask your TD for backup if you need help.
- Minimize casual discussion between questions. For example, don’t let teams talk during other teams’ bonuses. Online tournaments take a long time, and extensive talk between questions may lead to long delays. 
- When you finish a question, go on to the next one as promptly as possible. If players start talking, don’t wait for them to stop; get their attention by announcing the next question loudly and start reading anyway. They will likely stop talking once they realize they’re missing gameplay.
- It’s okay to be friendly with teams before or after games, assuming time permits, but try to engage equally with all teams. Avoid the appearance of favoritism toward specific players/teams/schools you might be more familiar with.

## Handling misconduct
- Expectations for ethics and conduct are outlined in [Section I of ACF’s rules](https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/#i-ethics-and-conduct).
- Serious concerns about cheating and misconduct are important enough to pause the game for. Say something like “Sorry, I’m needed in the control room. Please bear with me for a moment, we'll unpause the game ASAP.” Then take a note of the incident and report it to the TD.
- If you have a scorekeeper, they can take over while you step out to report the incident. Alternatively, they can report it while you continue the game.
- Enforce misconduct rules during games, especially for cases of aggression, inappropriate comments, disruptive behavior, etc. Simply saying “please stop doing that” or “this behavior is not acceptable” can make a big difference. You can also warn players that you will alert the TD if the behavior continues.
- If players continue to be disruptive or inappropriate after your warnings, [report it to the TD](/online-moderator-training/#how-to-report-issues-to-a-td-or-to-a-designated-staffer) during or after the round.

## Protests
- If a team protests, you or your scorekeeper should quickly take note in the scoresheet of what is being protested (in general terms) and how the score would change if the protest were upheld.
- You are not responsible for resolving protests, so don’t get into a long debate with players about whether a protest is right or wrong. Note the protest in the scoresheet and move on. 
- At the end of the game, if any protest could change the game result, gather any needed additional information about the protests from the teams and officially report it to the TD. Since protests must be judged fairly, do not reveal which teams or players are involved.
- ACF’s rules concerning protests are available [here](https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/#h-protests). Depending on the tournament rules, some issues are not protestable, including moderator judgment. If you’re not sure if something is protestable, just mark a protest anyway, move on, and let the TD make the final determination. Trying to litigate whether or not something is protestable delays the match and, potentially, the whole tournament.

## Reading clearly
- Audio glitches may make it harder for players to understand you, so make sure to read as clearly as possible.
- After the first 5 questions, ask players for feedback on your reading, including volume and speed, and adjust if needed.
- If you’re unsure how to pronounce a word, pronounce it phonetically and move on. Don’t go back to fix it, unless you think your first pronunciation was actively misleading and that you can fix it in one more try.
- Many readers find that when reading for online tournaments, they talk louder and tire out their voice more. Players should be able to hear you well even if you speak at a comfortable, conversational volume, especially if you use a headset.

## How to report issues to a TD (or to a designated staffer)
Sections of this document recommend reporting issues to the TD (or a designated staffer). This section contains guidance for how, and under what circumstances, you should report those issues.
- Since tournaments have different setups, your TD should tell you their preferred method for reporting issues to them. If they don’t tell you, ask them. Some common options are:
    - Via a secure text channel (e.g. “#moderators”) only for the TD and moderators
        - Pro: seen by all moderators, who could help you if needed
        - Con: seen by all moderators, could distract them mid-match
    - Via private message (PM), a.k.a. direct message (DM), to the TD
        - Pro: only seen by the TD, could get the attention of the TD
        - Con: could distract busy TD mid-match
- While you should feel able to report any issue to the TD, not all issues need to be flagged immediately: 
    - Report issues that actively impact the progression of a game immediately, such as: technical or connection problems on your end, a player who continually disrupts the match and refuses to stop, or absent teams (unless the TD has explicitly instructed you to start at a particular time even if not all team members are present). 
    - Report protests that could affect the outcome of a match after the match is over.
    - For other issues, use your judgment. Be proactive about reporting cheating or misconduct, but your main role during a round is to keep it moving. You can use the time between rounds to report such issues or ask your scorekeeper to do so.

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 2:</b> Under what circumstances are you required to report a player to the TD?</p>
<ol>
<li>The team that won the match wishes to protest that their incorrect answer to a question should have been acceptable.</li>
<li>You repeatedly see or hear a player typing extensively, and then buzzing, while you are reading tossups.</li>
<li>While you are reading a bonus to one team, a player from the opposing team complains in the chat about having lost the buzzer race on the preceding tossup.</li>
<li>When you start the round, one team is missing a player who is listed on their roster, but that player shows up after 3 questions.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: B is correct. The behavior in B is consistent with cheating and should be reported to the TD. The protest in A is moot since it would benefit the game-winning team, so it doesn't need to be reported. The behavior in C is disruptive and should be stopped, but you have the option of handling it yourself or reporting it to the TD (or both). The situation in D should be noted in the scoresheet, but you don't need to specifically alert the TD.*

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 3:</b> After getting a tossup wrong, a player lodges a protest and begins to explain why their answer was actually correct. What should you do?</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediately inform the TD of the protest.</li>
<li>Search Google for the clue that the player is concerned about and decide whether their answer should be accepted.</li>
<li>Tell the player that the protest will be resolved if it matters at the end of the game, make a note about the protest in the scoresheet, and continue reading.</li>
<li>Throw out the tossup and read a replacement question instead.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: Answer C is correct. When a team protests, you should determine how the score would change if the protest were upheld, make a quick note about the protest circumstances in the scoresheet, and move on. Do not delay the game by getting into a debate about whether the protest is correct.*
*A is incorrect because the TD does not need to be informed of protests unless they could alter the game's outcome. As a moderator, you are not responsible for adjudicating protests or taking action to resolve them without guidance from the TD, so B and D are both incorrect.*

# Part 4: Advice for moderating online tournaments
## Setting up your environment in advance
Setting up your environment is one of the most important components of being an effective moderator, both online and in-person. This section includes advice for setting up both your physical space and your computer.
### Setting up your physical environment and equipment
- Use a headset. Sit in a quiet environment. Close unnecessary programs that can slow down your computer, as video calling is resource-intensive.
- [Test your equipment in advance](#appendix-a-testing-your-setup), and adjust settings as needed. You can do this with a friend over whichever platform you will be using, or you can do it on your own.
- Always keep water handy. Prepare a simple meal that is ready to eat when your lunch break starts. Avoid eating during or between matches; this can make it difficult to speak at length.
- If you live with others, inform them of your commitment ahead of time and ask them to minimize ambient noise and distractions.

### Setting up your screen
Moderating an online tournament requires you to keep track of many windows or tabs: questions, scoresheet, game voice chat, game text chat, moderator chat, lobby chat, and possibly others. Proper setup of your screen(s) is critical.
- Typically, moderators for online tournaments will have the questions in a window on the left, and the game text chat on the right, monitoring the right while reading from the left window.
    - An alternative setup would be to display the game text chat in a window towards the top of the screen, with the questions below.
- If you are reading the questions in Microsoft Word, consider using the “Split” tool under “Window” to view both tossups and bonuses simultaneously.
- Moderators who are also scorekeeping have an additional layer of complexity to handle.
    = The scoresheet is typically in a browser window. If you are also reading questions from another browser window, make sure you can switch between the two windows or tabs quickly using a keyboard shortcut. This will make switching back and forth considerably more efficient.
- Consider using an external device (e.g. a phone, tablet, or second monitor) if you have trouble handling many streams of information on one device. In particular, Discord video is highly resource-intensive. Try out your equipment beforehand to see if you can get a better connection by joining via phone and pulling up packets on your computer.

## When to start the match
- While you are waiting to start the next match, monitor the text and voice channels to know when both teams have joined. Don’t leave your computer.
- Unless the TD instructs you to wait, start when both teams are ready, or when instructed.
- Don’t wait too long for missing players or for tech issues; that causes long delays.
    - Unless the TD has instructed otherwise, you should report to the control room / staffer chat if you cannot start the room because players/teams are missing. (If the team is still in a match, there is no need to report it.)
- Do a quick roll call before starting the match. This ensures that all players can hear you, and vice versa.

## Gameplay
- Post a delimiter in the game room text chat before each tossup (“TU 1”), or delegate this task to the scorekeeper or a player.
- On tossups, players will buzz in by typing “buzz” in the game room text chat. When you see a new buzz, stop reading and recognize the player who buzzed first on your screen (i.e. call out the player’s name).
    - Players may see a different order of buzzes, but the order of buzzes on your screen is the official record and is not protestable.
- In buzzer races (i.e. multiple buzzes at once), disregard all other buzzes until you finish judging the first buzzer’s answer and “reset/clear the buzzer system,” so to speak. You can post a delimiter like “—” to indicate the reset/clear.
    - If a player on the other team really wants to buzz again immediately, they can “rebuzz.”
- After one player answers a tossup incorrectly, players on the other team may type non-substantive text in the chat (e.g. “raise”) to indicate to their teammates that they intend to buzz. 
- Players may not use external devices during gameplay. If they must, you can tell them to sub themselves out, wait for halftime/the end of the match, or call a timeout.

## Answers
- Players/teams are encouraged to speak their answers (on both tossups and bonuses), but may type them if they are in a situation that prevents them from speaking.
- For ACF tournaments, players are required to answer bonus parts by saying “Our answer is…” before giving their response. Moderators should only evaluate answers that are directed this way, and should not consider any other responses. 

## Timing
- Follow the tournament’s timing rules. For ACF tournaments, allow 8 seconds to answer either a tossup or a bonus part. Don’t keep waiting or prompting for an answer after the allotted time. Otherwise, tournaments take forever.
- You can hold up fingers or tap your desk to indicate counting down time.

## Scorekeeping
- Familiarize yourself with the tournament’s scoresheets before the tournament. Scorekeeping guidance depends highly on the specific scorekeeping system.
- ACF recommends using Ophir’s scorekeeping system. You can find guidance for this system [here](http://minkowski.space/quizbowl/manuals/scorekeeping/moderator.html).

## Troubleshooting technical issues
- If a technical issue prevents one player from hearing/answering questions, first finish the tossup/bonus cycle (unless both teams agree to an ad-hoc solution). Moderators are not responsible for players’ faulty equipment.
    - After the tossup/bonus cycle, wait briefly if the player is still experiencing light issues (e.g., if they need to disconnect and reconnect), but then move on.
    - Technical issues are not protestable.
- If a technical issue prevents you from reading questions or hearing players’ responses, and you have a scorekeeper, ask your scorekeeper if they are comfortable moderating while you troubleshoot the issue.
    - If you do not have a scorekeeper, you can still try to [troubleshoot the problem yourself](http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/players/troubleshooting-discord-technical-issues/), but don’t hold up the game indefinitely. Report the problem to the TD or control room and see if you can be replaced.

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 4:</b> You are moderating an online quizbowl tournament, and one of the two teams in your next round is late and can't be located. What should you do? You may select more than one answer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Notify the TD that your team is missing and cannot be located, and ask for further instructions.</li>
<li>Check in other rooms or channels to see if the missing team's room finished reading.</li>
<li>Continue waiting for the team to show up, and don't start reading without them unless the TD gives you permission to do so.</li>
<li>Attempt to contact the missing team.</li>
<li>Finish preparing for the next round by setting up the question window and preparing the scoresheet with the team that is present.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: All answers are correct. If a team is late, you should attempt to locate them by contacting them directly and/or looking in other game rooms or channels to see if their previous game is running long. If you are still unable to find them, you should let the TD know and wait for their decision on when to start the game. In the meantime, you should set up for your next game so that you’ll be ready to begin quickly when the team arrives.*

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 5:</b> You are reading a tossup. Player A on Team 1 buzzes first, and Player B on Team 2 buzzes right after. Player A gets the tossup incorrect. According to the online-specific ACF and PACE rulesets, what is the correct thing to do next?</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognize Player B, who can either answer or withdraw.</li>
<li>Ask Player B if they would like to withdraw their buzz.</li>
<li>Continue reading the tossup and watch for any further buzzes from Team 2.</li>
<li>Ask all players on Team 2 if they would like to buzz.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: Only answer C is correct. Answers A and B are incorrect because after the first player’s buzz is recognized, all other buzzes become invalid. No other buzzes made before the moderator judges the first player’s answer should be recognized. Player B must rebuzz for their buzz to count, and therefore there is no need to withdraw. Answer D is also incorrect. While it is true that only players from Team 2 can buzz for the rest of this tossup, moderators should not prompt for buzzes or answers on tossups.*

## Part 4b: Zoom
- Zoom does not give participants large amounts of control over audio settings. Thankfully, its default settings are usually sufficient for quizbowl tournaments.
    - Regardless, make sure to test your external microphone using the tool provided in **Settings → Audio**. If you cannot hear yourself, make sure you have selected your external microphone and not your computer’s built-in microphone.
- As soon as you enter your room on the morning of the tournament, make sure the following settings are enabled under **Security: Enable Waiting Room, Chat, Rename Themselves, Unmute Themselves**. The other settings should be disabled. 
    - If **Chat** does not appear under security settings, recheck 1) with your tournament director (if using breakout rooms) or 2) on Zoom’s website under **Settings → In Meeting (Basic)** (if using your personal room).
- There are two accepted methods for buzzer systems in Zoom tournaments: the website BuzzIn.Live, and Zoom’s built-in chat. 
    - [This page](http://www.pace-nsc.org/moderating-and-scorekeeping-a-match-on-zoom-buzzin-live-method/) in PACE’s guide to Zoom tournaments covers the BuzzIn.Live method.
    - [This page](http://www.pace-nsc.org/moderating-and-scorekeeping-a-match-on-zoom-built-in-chat-method/) in PACE’s guide to Zoom tournaments covers the built-in chat method.

## Part 4c: Discord
- Refer to [PACE’s guide to Discord audio settings](http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/staffers/discord-audio-settings/) for information on lowering microphone sensitivity (for voice activity) and disabling some notifications.
- To view both the text chat and the video feeds simultaneously, click the Pop Out icon in the lower right of the video channel window.

![](/assets/discord-pop-out.jpg)

- For general guidance on troubleshooting quizbowl tournaments on Discord, read [http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/staffers/troubleshooting-discord-technical-issues/](http://www.pace-nsc.org/online-tournament-guide/staffers/troubleshooting-discord-technical-issues/).
- If you are waiting for a player who is just sitting in the wrong voice channel, you can (given proper permissions) move them between voice channels yourself. Right click on the player and select “Move To”.


# Review: Quiz
<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 6:</b> A player buzzes in during a tossup question. According to the <a href = '/gameplay-rules/'>ACF</a> and <a href = 'http://www.pace-nsc.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/191027_PACE_ruleset.pdf'>PACE</a> rules, which of the following statements are correct?</p>
<ol>
<li>The player who buzzed in has 8 seconds to answer before the moderator calls time.</li>
<li>Other team members are allowed to talk with the player who buzzed in before that player gives their answer.</li>
<li>The moderator immediately stops reading the tossup and recognizes the player who buzzed.</li>
<li>If that player gives an incorrect answer, other people on that player’s team may buzz in once the moderator continues reading.</li>
<li>Players on the other team are allowed to gesture over video (or type non-substantive text, such as “raising buzzer”) to signal to teammates that they intend to buzz in later.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: A, C, and E are correct. According to the ACF and PACE rules for online (though not in-person) quizbowl, players have 8 seconds to answer tossups. When one or more players buzz, the moderator should immediately stop reading and recognize the first player who buzzed. Players may communicate non-substantively over video or text to indicate their intention to buzz. B is not correct: the player who buzzes in must answer a tossup without help from their teammates. Conferring is only allowed on bonuses. D is not correct: once one player on a team has answered a tossup incorrectly, no other player from that team may buzz on that question.*

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 7:</b> You are reading a team a bonus question. According to the ACF and PACE rules, which of the following statements are correct?</p>
<ol>
<li>You should not prompt teams to give you an answer. If they do not give an answer to the bonus part within 5 seconds, call “Time” and award 0 points for that bonus part.</li>
<li>The first answer that a team member clearly and obviously directs to you – even if they did not say “directed” – is that team’s official answer. Your judgment on whether a player directed an answer to you is not protestable.</li>
<li>Only the team’s captain must direct the official answer to you. A team may get 2 additional seconds to answer if its captain says “Defer” or “Designate” indicating that a specific teammate should answer.</li>
<li>If you accidentally reveal one or more bonus answers to a team, you only need to read a replacement bonus if the result of the bonus would change the outcome of a match. If a team answered a bonus part incorrectly before you revealed a different answer, they will not receive 30 points on the replacement bonus even if they answer all 3 parts correctly.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: D is correct: see Sections E.9 and E.10 of the ACF rules. Moderator errors of this type are only resolved if they can alter the outcome of the game, and cannot result in the affected team getting points for bonus parts that they had already answered incorrectly. A is not correct: the moderator should prompt for an answer after 7 seconds (Section E.5). B is not correct: only answers that are preceded or followed by the word "directed" will be considered an official answer in an online game (Section E.4.A). C is not correct: any player may direct a bonus answer (Section E.4.D) and teams do not receive additional time by deferring to a specific teammate (Section E.4.E).*

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 8:</b>According to the ACF standard rules, which of these situations are protestable?</p>
<ol>
<li>A player argues that the moderator misheard their answer and mistakenly ruled them incorrect.</li>
<li>A player argues that the opposing team gave an answer that was accepted but should have been prompted for more information.</li>
<li>A player argues that they gave a correct but not sufficiently specific answer, and should have been prompted, but was ruled incorrect instead.</li>
<li>A player argues that the opposing team was ruled correct for an answer that should have been ruled incorrect, either to an error by either the packet or moderator.</li>
<li>A player claims that they were given only 6 seconds to answer a tossup rather than the full 8.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: C and D are correct. Answers that are ruled incorrect may be protested on the grounds that they should have received a prompt (Section H.5.E), and answers that are accepted may be protested on the grounds that they should have been ruled incorrect (Section H.5.F). A is not correct: "what the moderator heard" is not protestable (Section H.6.A) although if both teams agree that a moderator misheard an answer, the moderator should re-evaluate the actual answer. B is not correct: unlike answers that are ruled incorrect, answers that were accepted cannot be protested on the grounds that they should have been prompted (Section H.6.B.vii). E is not correct: although the moderator should always try to allow the full time to answer, moderator judgment calls of any kind, including timing, are not protestable (Section H.6.B.i).*

<div class = 'training-question'>
<p class = 'training-question-text'><b>Question 9:</b> You are preparing to moderate a game of online quizbowl. What should you do before you begin a match?</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a roll call to ensure that all players on both teams are present and ready to play.</li>
<li>Ensure that players can hear your voice clearly. </li>
<li>If the tournament requires players to have their cameras turned on, ensure that all players are using cameras.</li>
<li>Arrange your computer windows so that the questions, the game text channel, and (if scorekeeping) the scoresheet is visible.</li>
<li>Test your computer’s microphone before the tournament.</li>
</ol>
</div>

*Explanation: All answers are correct. Before beginning a round, you should ensure that all players are ready to play, can hear you (and each other), and have video on if required. You should also make sure that your computer screen setup enables you to carry out all your moderating tasks easily. Regarding answer E, you should make sure that your microphone is adequate well in advance of the tournament so that you have time to troubleshoot if necessary. If possible, you should purchase and use an external microphone so that you are not relying on your computer's built-in microphone.*

# Appendix A: Testing your setup
## Computer
- Ensure you can have the game room, your packet, and a scoresheet (if scorekeeping) pulled up and accessible.
    - These do not have to be on the same screen, but should all be quickly accessible (such as with a secondary workspace or a keyboard shortcut like Alt-Tab).
- If your tournament is on Discord, make sure you can join the Discord server and that your permissions are set up (e.g. you can see the #moderators channel and your game rooms).

## Audio
- Log into Discord/Zoom and use the app to test your microphone and speakers.
    - Discord: User Settings > Voice and Video > Let's Check
    - Zoom: arrow by Mute button in a call > Test Speaker and Microphone
- If possible, have someone else join a call with you and read them a tossup/bonus cycle or two.
    - Make sure you are clear all the way through your sentences. If you are cutting out on Discord, consider switching to Push-to-Talk in Voice and Video.
    - Ensure you can quickly you can switch between reading the packet and checking Discord/Zoom for buzzes.
