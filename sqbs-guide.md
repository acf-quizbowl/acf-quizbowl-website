## Quizbowl Resource Center Database
- The tournament listing should be formatted like "[Year] ACF [Tournament] at [School]" *(e.g. “2019 ACF Regionals at Toronto”)*
- To upload statistics for an existing database entry on the [Quizbowl Resource Center Database](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/), `Upload SQBS Reports → Select tournament → Add stat report`
    - Only the owner of a database entry may post statistics for it. The owner of a database entry can change the owner (From the database entry page, `Edit Tournament Listing → Change Owner`)

## Team and Player Names
- Always use players’ full first and last names
- After both player and school names, indicate "(DII)" or "(UG)" as applicable, even if there are not enough Division II and/or Undergraduate schools to award trophies (e.g. “Jane Doe (DII)” or “Michigan State (UG)”)
    - For Division II players, it is not necessary to indicate both DII and UG

## Multi-Phase Tournaments
- If the tournament uses multiple preliminary pools, label them separately as divisions (File → New Tournament → Use Divisions)
- If tournament uses multiple phases like preliminary rounds and playoff games, statistics should be posted for each phase separately, as well as a combined file for all phases. `Settings → General → Rounds Included In Reports`, then generate separate reports.
- When breaking ties, it may be necessary to seed teams by points per game, only including games against opponents that both teams played (see ACF’s [Formats](/formats/) guidelines). After saving a safe copy of the tournament results, delete non-common games for the teams involved in the tiebreaker.
    - Deleting a game cannot be undone, so exercise care!

## Miscellaneous
Enter the packet names exactly as they appear in the file name (`Settings → Packet Names`)
Enable round reports (`Settings → General → Include Round Reports`)
