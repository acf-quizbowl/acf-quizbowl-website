ACF produces and runs four major academic quizbowl tournaments per year:

* **[ACF Fall](fall)**
  * ACF Fall is a novice tournament held in mid-October. It is for players who are new to collegiate quizbowl who do not have significant experience with high-school quizbowl.
* **[ACF Winter](winter)**
  * ACF Winter is a medium-difficulty tournament held in mid-November. It is for both new and experienced players alike.
* **[ACF Regionals](regionals)**
  * ACF Regionals is a regional championship tournament held in January or February. It serves as a qualifier for ACF Nationals.
* **[ACF Nationals](nationals)**
  * ACF Nationals is the premier collegiate national championship held in April. To participate in ACF Nationals, teams must qualify by performing well at ACF Regionals, or may apply for wildcard bids.
