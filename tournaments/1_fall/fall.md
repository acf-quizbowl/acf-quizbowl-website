**ACF Fall** is a medium-difficulty tournament (halfway between ACF Fall and ACF Regionals). It is meant for players with a variety of experiences: from players in their first semester of college quizbowl, to players who have been to ACF Nationals. ACF Fall was revived in 2020; the original iterations of ACF Fall were held in 2009 and 2010.
