### Packet Distribution & Authorship

Email [nationals@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com) to request a distribution for either a half or full packet. The head editor(s) will respond with a template specifying which categories you are assigned to write.

Additionally, if you submit a packet before registering for ACF Nationals and subsequently do not attend, whether because you do not qualify or because you choose not to attend, that packet can still be used in ACF Nationals. Any discount earned by that packet will then roll over to the next ACF tournament that your school attends. If the discount is greater than $70 (ACF's share of tournament fees), it can be spread among multiple teams from the same school, or the difference between $70 and the amount of the discount can be rolled over to a further tournament. Rolling over a packet discount for ACF Nationals does not preclude submitting a packet for future ACF tournaments, should that be required.

Your assigned packet may ask for questions from more specific categories within the distribution. For instance, instead of being assigned an “American Literature” tossup, you might be asked to write a question on 20th-century American poetry, or an Economics bonus instead of “Social Science/Philosophy.”

Before writing, please review [ACF’s packet submission guidelines](/guidelines/packet-sub) and stick to the format provided. Questions should be written in 10 pt Times New Roman with one-inch margins. Although you may submit longer questions, tossups will be capped at 7 lines for the tournament. Each bonus part should be a maximum of 3 lines in length, with the majority being 1 or 2 lines long. Teams may be asked to edit submissions, which may lead to them missing deadlines, if multiple questions are much too short or much too long.

When finished, submit your packet by emailing it to [nationals@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com).

* Please format the packet as a `.docx` or `.doc` before sending it.
* The email subject line should list the name of the school, the team number (if applicable), and the word “half-packet” or “quarter packet.”
* To to meet a given deadline, the finished packet must be sent to that email before 11:59 Pacific Time on the corresponding listed day.

If multiple teams from one school are submitting packets, they should NOT be aware of each others’ questions. Any roster changes that entail an author for one packet playing for another (e.g., if a player on Team B moves to Team A) should be flagged to the [Nationals TD](mailto:td@acf-quizbowl.com) AND to [nationals@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com).

### Tips & Guidelines

* Tossup answerlines should generally emphasize playability over creativity; aim for creative and interesting clues with straightforward answerlines. Especially if you are submitting for one of the later deadlines, the frequency of topic clashes means that broad common-link questions are unlikely to be used.
* When writing bonuses, aim for the easy parts to have 90% conversion, medium parts to have 50% conversion, and hard parts to have 10% conversion.

More information can be found in [ACF’s packet submission guidelines](/guidelines/packet-sub).
