## Bid Acceptance

1. All teams that qualify via A-value or autobid must inform ACF of the acceptance of their bid by **February 15, 2022**. Bid responses should be submitted using the [ACF bid response form](https://forms.gle/Quwdu5a5MfzT6b8ZA).

2. If the field does not fill once the bid acceptance deadline is reached, then all available bids will be awarded in order of descending A-value.

## Waitlist

1. Teams that have not received a bid to ACF Nationals are invited to sign up for a waitlist.To sign up for the waitlist, teams will fill out an ACF bid response form, entering "Other" for the team name and entering the team name in the waitlist team name field.
2. If a team declines a bid, that bid will be offered to the teams on the waitlist, in order of descending A-value.

## Standby

1. ACF also generally looks for teams willing to serve as standby teams in case of last-minute drops. Standby teams must commit to showing up to the tournament day-of; if there are any open spots, they will be able to play ACF Nationals for no entry fee. Otherwise, they are free to staff or explore the Twin Cities.
2. To sign up as a standby team, please email the Nationals Tournament Director at [td@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:td@acf-quizbowl.com).
