# 2021 ACF Fall
[2021 ACF Fall](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=25261) will be held on October 16, 2021.

## Editors
2021 ACF Fall is head-edited by Katherine Lei and edited by Sarah Benner, Justin Duffy, Karan Gurazada, Mitch McCullar, Gov Prabhakar, Ethan Strombeck, and Ned Tagtmeier. Justin Duffy, Matthew Lehmann, Matthew Bollinger, and other ACF members are offering oversight.

## Online format
We hope that ACF Fall can be held in person. However, we acknowledge that many schools are uncertain about the possibility of allowing large events due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it is possible that some mirrors of ACF Fall will be held online, and we will work to create the most authentic and engaging quizbowl experience possible under these circumstances. We will continue to post updates as we learn more.

## Registration
The registration form for ACF Fall will be available after hosts have been announced.

## Field
The field for each site can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hrgokKUJukxb6UmNnrAMwjnScDbiTsOTKAKB40Gunvc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Fees

- Base fee per team: $120
- New to quizbowl discount: −$80
- Shorthanded discount (1–2 players): −$60
- Staffers: −$25 per staffer with functional laptop. Staffers must register with ACF in advance.

<!-- need to reinstate buzzer/travel discounts? -->

The "new to quizbowl" discount is for schools that have not sent a team to any mainstream collegiate academic tournament (not counting exclusively novice tournaments) since September 2020, and which have no players who competed in non-novice collegiate tournaments during that same period.

Host sites will bill teams as soon as possible after the teams register. Teams should pay their host sites by whatever method is convenient for the hosts, who will in turn pay ACF by check, cash, or PayPal.

See below for packet submission discounts.

## Packet submission
Like 2020 ACF Fall, no teams are required to submit questions in order to play the tournament. However, ACF still needs high-quality, half-packet submissions from teams to complete the set.

Below is the submission schedule for ACF Fall. All deadlines are at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time. All submitting teams are eligible for an additional −$20 quality discount if their questions are particularly polished and usable, up to a maximum discount of −$60. Teams may submit a maximum of one half-packet.

- August 21, 2021: −$50
- August 28, 2021: −$40
- September 4, 2021: −$30
- September 11, 2021: −$20
- September 18, 2021: −$10

If you would like to submit a half-packet, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUin-wIZeG1dJa-8JRtfKhhzhSbN924JHDuIU6GZxJHZcpCA/viewform). ACF will respond with a half-packet template specifying which categories you are assigned to write.

Each submission consists of 12 tossups and 12 bonuses. Before writing, please review [ACF's packet submission guidelines](/packet-submission-guidelines) and stick to the format provided. Answers should generally emphasize playability over creativity – aim for creative and interesting clues with straightforward answerlines. These [5 model tossups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mokTuDeyDDSb4J1yQG6BWeGsee4x-RFsqf-lmvfBXjc/edit?usp=sharing) reflect the difficulty and style to aim for. When finished, submit your half-packet by emailing it to [fall@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:fall@acf-quizbowl.com).

Your assigned half-packet may ask you to write questions from specific categories within the distribution. For instance, instead of being assigned an “American Literature” tossup, you might be asked to write a question on a 20th-century American poem, or an Economics bonus instead of “Social Science/Philosophy.” This should reduce redundancy in submissions and maximize the number of submitted questions we can use, without being too constraining. The submission form offers space to indicate your writing interests in each category, which we will do our best to accommodate.

## Hosts
If you are interested in hosting a mirror of ACF Fall or have questions about hosting, email ACF’s Site Coordinator at [hosting@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com). Hosts must abide by ACF’s [Hosting Guidelines](/hosting-guidelines).
