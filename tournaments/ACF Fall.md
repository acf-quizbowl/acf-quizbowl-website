**ACF Fall** is the premier easy tournament in college quizbowl. Designed as an introduction to college quizbowl for novices and players with limited high school experience, over 200 teams compete on ACF Fall each year, making it the most widely-played set in the college calendar.

## 2020 ACF Fall
2020 ACF Fall will be held on October 17, 2020. It will be head-edited by Ben Miller, with assistance from Matthew Lehmann. New for 2020, packet submission will not be required for ACF Fall; teams will still be allowed to submit packets for a discount, but it will not be mandatory to play ACF Fall.

An application to edit ACF Fall will be released this spring.
