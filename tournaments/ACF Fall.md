**ACF Fall** is the premier easy tournament in college quizbowl. Designed as an introduction to college quizbowl for novices and players with limited high school experience, over 200 teams compete on ACF Fall each year, making it the most widely-played set in the college calendar.

ACF Fall 2019 will be held on **November 2nd, 2019**. You can find the HSQB forum announcement [here](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=23034).

## Packet submission

Any team with at least two people on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2018, is required to submit a half-packet, unless it is a high school team attending a high-school-only mirror. If you are unsure whether your team is required to submit a half-packet, please email us at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[fall@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:fall@acf-quizbowl.com)</span>.

- For these purposes, all ACF tournaments, NAQT SCT (Division I or Division II), NAQT ICT, and typical college-level academic invitationals count as regular collegiate academic tournaments. Pop culture or “hybrid” tournaments, HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT’s Collegiate Novice series sets do not.

The submission schedule is as follows (your submission must be sent to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[fall@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:fall@acf-quizbowl.com)</span> by 11:59 PM PDT):

- **September 7:** –$30
- **September 21:** –$15 (–$30 if optional)
- **October 5:** no penalty (–$15 if optional)
- **October 12:** +$25
- **October 19:** +$50

*Packets submitted later than October 20 will receive an additional penalty of +$10 per day starting on October 21.*

If your team is obligated to submit a half-packet or wishes to do so, email <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[fall@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:fall@acf-quizbowl.com)</span> to request a 12/12 distribution.

Please refer to the [ACF Packet Submission Guidelines](/packet-submission-guidelines) when writing and submitting your packet.

## Distribution

## High school teams and high-school-only mirrors 

In order to encourage growth in small circuits that would benefit from a larger field, ACF will allow high school teams to attend select collegiate mirrors of ACF Fall. Collegiate hosts interested in having high school teams attend their mirror should contact <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[hosting@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com)</span> to apply for an exemption. If this exemption is granted, hosts will work with the ACF mirror coordinator to assess high school teams’ requests to play the tournament on a case-by-case basis. This policy is not intended to let strong high school teams play against new collegiate teams, but rather to strengthen small collegiate circuits that would benefit from a larger field with local high school teams of comparable strength. 

ACF is also willing to provide the set for high-school-only tournaments. Those interested in hosting a high-school-only mirror of 2019 ACF Fall should express interest by email to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[hosting@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com)</span>. 

ACF will not delay the discussion or public availability of ACF Fall questions after the weekend of November 2. High school sites are welcome to express interest in holding mirrors on other dates, but they do so at their own question security risk.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please forward them to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[fall@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:fall@acf-quizbowl.com)</span>.
