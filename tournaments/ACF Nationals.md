**ACF Nationals** is the premier collegiate quizbowl national championship. For over 25 years, ACF Nationals has been the ultimate test of collegiate quizbowl teams' skill on the hardest and biggest question set of the season.

## 2021 ACF Nationals 
2021 ACF Nationals was postponed until summer 2021. More information will be posted at a later date.

Matt Bollinger (alumnus of the University of Virginia) and Ryan Westbrook (alumnus of the University of Michigan and Wayne State University) will be head editors.

Bids to host 2021 ACF Nationals will likely occur in the summer of 2020. For more information, contact the Site Coordinator at [hosting@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com).

## 2020 ACF Nationals
[2020 ACF Nationals](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=23261) was cancelled due to COVID-19. Teams should not spoil any packets that were submitted for 2020 ACF Nationals, as they may be able to resubmit for 2021 ACF Nationals.

## Distribution
The submitted packet and final packet distributions for ACF Nationals are found [here](/distribution).

## Qualifying for ACF Nationals
[ACF Regionals](/regionals) serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification). 

As with any ACF tournament, failing to play off or award any applicable Undergraduate and Division II titles at Regionals will incur a penalty (see [Penalties](/hosting-guidelines/#penalties-for-egregious-hosting-violations)). In the event that a host’s failure to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.

## Staffing
If you would like to staff ACF Nationals, email both [td@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:td@acf-quizbowl.com) and [staffing@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:staffing@acf-quizbowl.com) with the subject line "ACF Nationals staffing."
