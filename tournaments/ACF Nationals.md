ACF Nationals will tentatively be held **August 7-8 at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.** The final date and location have not been confirmed yet; for more information, ACF is posting updates in [this forums thread](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=25133).

Matt Bollinger (alumnus of the University of Virginia) and Ryan Westbrook (alumnus of the University of Michigan and Wayne State University) will be head editors.

## 2020 ACF Nationals
[2020 ACF Nationals](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=23261) was cancelled due to COVID-19.

Teams should not spoil any packets that were submitted for 2020 ACF Nationals, as they may be able to resubmit for 2021 ACF Nationals.

## Distribution
The submitted packet and final packet distributions for ACF Nationals are found [here](/distribution).

## Qualifying for ACF Nationals
[ACF Regionals](/regionals) ordinarily serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACFâ€™s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification). 

If an ACF Regionals host fails to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles, or an event precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.
