## 2022 ACF Nationals
[2022 ACF Nationals](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=25391) will be held on April 9–10, 2022.

2022 ACF Nationals is head edited by John Lawrence. Will Alston, Stephen Eltinge, Stephen Liu, Eric Mukherjee, and Adam Silverman are editors.

## Qualifying for ACF Nationals
[ACF Regionals](/regionals) serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification).

If an ACF Regionals host fails to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles, or an event precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.
