**ACF Nationals** is the premier collegiate quizbowl national championship. For over 25 years, ACF Nationals has been the ultimate test of collegiate quizbowl teams' skill on the hardest and biggest question set of the season.

## 2021 ACF Nationals
2021 ACF Nationals was postponed until summer 2021. ACF Nationals will be held **August 7-8 at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.**

Matt Bollinger (alumnus of the University of Virginia) and Ryan Westbrook (alumnus of the University of Michigan and Wayne State University) will be head editors.

### COVID-19 precautions
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all players and spectators will be required to wear masks at ACF Nationals, regardless of vaccination status. Participants are strongly recommended to get vaccinated before attending.

Staff will be required to wear masks while not actively moderating; in order to be allowed to moderate without a mask, staff must show a negative COVID-19 test taken in the prior 5 days.

### Qualification changes for 2021
In 2021, ACF Regionals will not serve as the qualifier for ACF Nationals. The [new qualification method](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=24836) was announced on January 29, 2021, and took place on the weekend of April 3, 2021.

## 2020 ACF Nationals
[2020 ACF Nationals](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=23261) was cancelled due to COVID-19.

Teams should not spoil any packets that were submitted for 2020 ACF Nationals, as they may be able to resubmit for 2021 ACF Nationals.

## Distribution
The submitted packet and final packet distributions for ACF Nationals are found [here](/distribution).

## Qualifying for ACF Nationals
[ACF Regionals](/regionals) ordinarily serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACFâ€™s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification).

If an ACF Regionals host fails to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles, or an event precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.
