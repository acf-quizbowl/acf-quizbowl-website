**ACF Nationals** is the ACF collegiate national championship. For over 25 years, ACF Nationals has been the ultimate test of collegiate quizbowl teams' skill on the best question set of the year.


## ACF Nationals 2020
ACF Nationals 2020 will be held on the weekend of **April 18th, 2020 at University of Minnesota - Twin Cities**. You can find the HSQB forum announcement [here](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=23261).

Ryan Westbrook, alumnus of the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, will be head editor.

## Apply to host
ACF is currently soliciting bids to host ACF Nationals 2020. To bid, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17cCm6UsNtuu0UBkbxzJJCo7mnMy-CfC1DSElk-3SjOM/viewform). For any questions, please contact [the ACF Mirror Coordinator](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com).

## Qualifying for ACF Nationals
[ACF Regionals](/regionals) serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification). As with any ACF tournament, failing to play off or award any applicable Undergraduate and Division II titles at Regionals will incur a penalty (see [Penalties](/hosting-guidelines/#penalties-for-egregious-hosting-violations)). In the event that a host’s failure to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.
