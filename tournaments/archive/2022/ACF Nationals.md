## Hosting
ACF is soliciting bids to host ACF Nationals. To bid, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/79qWqZ9iahkcqhJF6).

## Qualifying for ACF Nationals
[ACF Regionals](/regionals) serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification).

If an ACF Regionals host fails to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles, or an event precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- ### Qualification changes for 2022 -->
<!-- In 2022, ACF will allow online ACF Regionals sites to operate as full qualifiers for 2022 ACF Nationals, functioning identically to in-person sites. Winners of online sites and winners of the undergraduate championship at online sites (presuming at least four total undergraduate teams from at least two total schools are present) will earn automatic qualification to ACF Nationals, with all other participating teams being entered into the A-value list for at-large qualification. -->

<!-- Players at online ACF Regionals sites will be required to follow ACF's new [integrity policy for online play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8uR9u6WDe-A3H2aqHTLkaVQvivprgfsICYt1G6C8Rs/edit). -->
<!-- todo: make that doc into static page, under /policies/ -->

## Packet submission
The editors of ACF Nationals are planning on writing 13 packets this year. **Unlike recent years, packet submission for 2023 ACF Nationals will be mandatory.** However, teams will only be required to submit half-packets. Teams should request a half-packet distribution by emailing [nationals@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com).

Finalized tossups for 2023 ACF Nationals will be capped at 8 lines in 10-point Times New Roman. However, this cap does not apply to submissions; submitting teams are allowed and encouraged to submit longer tossups.

The packet deadlines:

Packet discount | Submission deadline
- | -
-$100 | Sunday, November 27
-$50  | Sunday, January 1
-$25  | Sunday, January 22
-$0   | Sunday, February 12
+$25  | Sunday, March 5
+$50  | Sunday, March 26

Later packet submissions will be charged $10/day late.

Additionally, if you submit a packet before registering for the tournament and subsequently do not attend ACF Nationals, whether because you do not qualify or because you choose not to attend, that packet can still be used for ACF Nationals. The discount the packet would have earned will roll over to the next ACF tournament that the school sends a team to. If the discount is greater than $70 (ACF's share of tournament fees), it can be spread among multiple teams from the same school, or the difference between $70 and the amount of the discount can be rolled over to a further tournament. Rolling over a discount does not preclude submitting a packet for the next ACF tournament, should that be required.

All packet submission deadlines are at 11:59 p.m. Central Time. Packets must be submitted to [nationals@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com). We will continue to offer an additional −$50 quality discount to any team that submits a polished packet with almost all questions usable with little to no editing.

## Fees

Team entry fee or discount         |
- | -
Base fee per team                  | $350
Buzzer discount                    | -$10 per functioning buzzer system (with eight functioning buzzers).
Staffer discount                   | -$150 for each staffer capable of reading a round in ca. 35 minutes. Staffers must register with ACF in advance.

Teams will owe half the registration fee if they drop from the field with less than four weeks to go before the tournament and the full registration fee if they drop from the field with less than two weeks to go before the tournament.
