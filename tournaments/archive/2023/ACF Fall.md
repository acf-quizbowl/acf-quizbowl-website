## Rules

## Registration
Fill out the central 2023 ACF Fall registration form with all relevant information [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-v1R14baVKdREy7FfpyAr9SZD49pocWrX9Rd71SF5bmxmbw/viewform?usp=sf_link). The field for each site can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BteIE1SlD6w0KjgUcNmaKzhe0-Qj4VMArAlZ7Uv9A-A/edit?usp=sharing). Confirmed tournament sites are also listed below under Hosting.

If possible, teams should register for the site that is geographically closest to them and/or is in the region they would normally attend. After the field cap for their site is reached, teams will be placed on a waitlist or potentially assigned to another site. Please register by October 9th, 2023.

## Fees

Team entry fee or discount         |
-                                  | -
Base fee per team                  | $120
New to quizbowl discount           | −$80
Shorthanded discount (1–2 players) | −$60
Staffers                           | −$25 per staffer with functional laptop. Staffers must register with ACF in advance.

The minimum fee is $0 per team.

The "new to quizbowl" discount is for schools that did not send a team to any regular collegiate academic tournament (not counting exclusively novice tournaments) since September 2022, and which have no players who competed in non-novice collegiate tournaments during that same period.

Host sites will bill teams as soon as possible after the teams register. Teams should pay their host sites by whatever method is convenient for the hosts, who will in turn pay ACF by check, cash, or PayPal.

See below for packet submission discounts.

## Packet submission
As for the past few editions of ACF Fall, no teams are required to submit questions in order to play the tournament. However, ACF still needs high-quality half-packet submissions from teams to complete the set.

**If a team wishes to outsource part of its packet to a player not expected to play on that team (e.g., a student who has graduated), it must first receive approval from the head editors. Non-playing students are welcome and encouraged to help their newer club members write, especially for Fall, but it's useful to know the contributors for both credit and logistical reasons.**

Below is the submission schedule for ACF Fall. All deadlines are at 11:59 p.m. PT. In addition to these, all submitting teams are eligible for an additional −$20 quality discount if their questions are particularly polished and usable, up to a maximum discount of −$60. Each team may submit a maximum of one half-packet.

Submission deadline | Packet discount
- | -
August 20, 2023    | −$50
August 27, 2023    | −$40
September 3, 2023  | −$30
September 10, 2023 | −$20
September 17, 2023 | −$10

If you would like to submit a half-packet, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds94iXJ48JkaJYVLAqsq3MMkYrhJP5CEWO6FXzC8_x0_Mo4A/viewform?usp=sf_link). ACF will respond with a half-packet template specifying which categories you are assigned to write.

Each submission consists of 12 tossups and 12 bonuses. Before writing, please review ACF's [packet submission guidelines](/packet-submission-guidelines/) and stick to the format provided. Answers should generally emphasize playability over creativity; aim for creative and interesting clues with straightforward answer lines. These [5 model tossups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17VLdJnbHdihdJH4VWF11JtnAsz3t0bAWJnry6LKbAFU/edit?usp=sharing) from the 2020 edition of ACF Fall reflect the difficulty and style to aim for. When finished, submit your half-packet by emailing it to fall@acf-quizbowl.com.

Your assigned half-packet may ask for questions from more specific categories within the distribution. For instance, instead of being assigned an “American Literature” tossup, you might be asked to write a question on a 20th-century American poem, or an Economics bonus instead of “Social Science/Philosophy.” This should reduce redundancy in submissions and maximize the number of submitted questions we can use, without being too constraining. The submission form offers space to indicate your writing interests in each category, which we will do our best to accommodate.

## Distribution
ACF Fall uses the [standard ACF distribution](/distribution).

## Eligibility
