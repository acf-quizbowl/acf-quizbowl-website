## Qualifying for ACF Nationals
[ACF Regionals](/regionals) serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification).

<!-- ### Qualification changes for 2022 -->
<!-- In 2022, ACF will allow online ACF Regionals sites to operate as full qualifiers for 2022 ACF Nationals, functioning identically to in-person sites. Winners of online sites and winners of the undergraduate championship at online sites (presuming at least four total undergraduate teams from at least two total schools are present) will earn automatic qualification to ACF Nationals, with all other participating teams being entered into the A-value list for at-large qualification. -->

<!-- Players at online ACF Regionals sites will be required to follow ACF's new [integrity policy for online play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8uR9u6WDe-A3H2aqHTLkaVQvivprgfsICYt1G6C8Rs/edit). -->

## Packet submission
The editors of ACF Nationals are planning to write 12 editors’ packets and produce 12 packets from team submissions. **Unlike recent years, packet submission for 2024 ACF Nationals will be mandatory.** However, teams will only be required to submit half-packets. Teams should request a half-packet distribution by emailing [nationals@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com).

Finalized tossups for 2024 ACF Nationals will be capped at 850 characters in 10 pt Times New Roman. Bonuses will be capped at 750 characters. However, this cap does not apply to submissions; submitting teams are allowed and encouraged to submit longer questions.

The packet deadlines:

Packet discount | Submission deadline
- | -
-$75 (-$150 for a full packet) | Sunday, December 3
-$50 (-$100 for a full packet) | Sunday, December 24
-$25 (-$50 for a full packet) | Sunday, January 14
-$0 (-$25 for a full packet)  | Sunday, February 4
+$25  | Sunday, February 25
+$50  | Sunday, March 17

Later packet submissions will be charged $10/day late.

Additionally, if you submit a packet before registering for the tournament and subsequently do not attend ACF Nationals, whether because you do not qualify or because you choose not to attend, that packet can still be used for ACF Nationals. The discount the packet would have earned will roll over to the next ACF tournament that the school sends a team to. If the discount is greater than $70 (ACF's share of tournament fees), it can be spread among multiple teams from the same school, or the difference between $70 and the amount of the discount can be rolled over to a further tournament. Rolling over a discount does not preclude submitting a packet for the next ACF tournament, should that be required.

All packet submission deadlines are due by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the given day. Packets must be submitted to [nationals@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com). Quality discounts may be awarded for packets that have a substantial number of questions that are usable with less editing. Quality discounts may be larger or smaller depending on the number of such questions.

## Fees

Team entry fee or discount         |
- | -
Base fee per team                  | $350
Buzzer discount                    | -$20 per functioning buzzer system (with eight functioning buzzers). Please note that the buzzer discount will be revoked, and a further penalty of $10 assessed, for buzzers that are non-functional upon arriving to ACF Nationals.
Staffer discount                   | -$100 for each staffer capable of reading a round in ca. 40 minutes.

Teams will owe half the registration fee if they drop from the field with less than four weeks to go before the tournament and the full registration fee if they drop from the field with less than two weeks to go before the tournament.
