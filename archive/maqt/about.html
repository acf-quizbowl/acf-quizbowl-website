<H1>About the Maryland Academic Quiz Team</H1></center>
The Maryland Academic Quiz Team is an organization at College Park devoted
to competing in and hosting academic trivia competitions. If you're not
familiar with such competitions, imagine <EM>Jeopardy!</EM> with harder
questions, more players, and the ability to buzz in and make Alex shut
his damned hole in the middle of the question.<P>

Though the team is willing to answer almost any kind of questions, from
sports trivia to Trivial Pursuit, we specialize in a format called ACF --
Academic Competition Foundation. Started in 1990 by John Nam and Ramesh
Kannappan of the MAQT and Carol Guthrie of Tennessee, ACF has become a
standard for quiz bowl questions. Games consist of 20 "tossup" questions,
answerable by either team. Upon answering a tossup correctly, the team that
does so receives a 30-point multiple-part bonus question. The questions are 
academic and structured to give more difficult clues first and easy clues 
last, thus rewarding the team with the greater knowledge.<P>

Unfortunately, ACF died a few years ago due to a number of reasons. A new ACF has
been formed, and the MAQT is fully behind the effort. David Hamilton
is the creator of the new ACF 
<A HREF="../acf/Welcome.html">website</A>, for which the MAQT is
providing space.<P>

A long time ago, the MAQT used to be affiliated with College Bowl, inc.
CBI, or "The Company" as it is affectionately known, used to be the only
game in town if you wanted to play in a national tournament against other
good quiz bowl teams. But the exorbitant price of CBI, along with the low
quality of their questions led the Maryland team to de-affiliate and
ultimately to start ACF as a low-cost, high-quality alternative to the
low-quality, high-cost College Bowl game.<P>

A relative newcomer to the format wars is NAQT, which is a timed format which
contains features reminiscent of both ACF and CBI, and probably best known
for its inclusion of power tossups. A recent surge in interest in trash
tournaments has led to the development of TRASH (Total Recall About Strange Happenings),
to whose tournaments we sent several teams last year.<P>

In addition to CBI and ACF, quiz teams at individual schools host
"invitational" tournaments. The "invitational circuit" varies from an
approximation to CBI (Georgetown, Vanderbilt, etc.) to ACF (Georgia
Tech's and Virginia's tournaments, just to name a few).<P>

Maryland's own invitational ACF-style tournament, the Terrapin
Invitational, is one of the oldest in the nation. In Fall of 1999, it will
be held for the thirteenth straight year.<P>

So, you may be wondering, how good is Maryland at quiz bowl? The answer: a
lot better than at football. Maryland is ranked number 2 in the nation. In
the seven times that the ACF National tournament has been held, Maryland has
taken second four times and third twice. Of the 10-14 invitational
tournaments the team attends each year, it wins between 7-8. This year,
Maryland placed third in ACF nationals and won 9 
tournaments.<P>

But enough chest-beating. If you want to join the team, we'd love to have
you. One of our goals is to give everyone who wants to play the
opportunity to compete at tournaments, and we often send 3 or more teams
to tournaments around the country. All levels of knowledge are welcome,
and it doesn't matter if you're a freshman or a grad student. The team is
good not because of astute recruiting, but because players get better by
playing. If you join the team, you can become a good player regardless of
where you start out.<P>

<H3>How can I join?</H3>

Come to one of our practices (see below), or contact Julie Singer at
<A HREF="mailto:jesinger@wam.umd.edu">jesinger@wam.umd.edu</A> or
301-314-5869.
<P>

<H3>Where and when are practices held?</H3>

Practices during the spring semester are on Monday and Thursday at 7:00 PM in 1117
Jimenez Hall. In addition, there is a practice for novices on Wednesday at the same
time. If some other group is in 1117 Jimenez, look in nearby rooms for a lot of people and a
buzzer system. Players from other schools are welcome to attend as long as they don't
start showing up to every practice.<P>
<!-- <STRONG>Important:</STRONG> Although we enjoy practicing with
players from other schools during the summer, we request that players
who are not affiliated with UMCP do not attend our practices during the
school year. If you have questions about this policy, please talk to 
David Hamilton. -->
