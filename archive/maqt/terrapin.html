Questions should either be e-mailed as text or sent on disk as a
Microsoft Word file (version 6.0 or higher) or in ASCII text.<P>

We may be willing to extend credit based on the entrance fee to your
tournament.  We will trade rather than sell questions.  Feel free to offer
us deals.<P>

In very rare cases, packet deadlines may be slightly negotiable.<P>

<H3>What makes the Terrapin different from most other tournaments?</H3>

<UL>

<LI>We offer a discount based on the quality of the packet submitted.  We
ask for a balanced packet of 25 toss-ups and 25 bonus questions in the ACF format.  If more
than 80% of your submitted questions are usable, you get $5 back.  If more
than 90% are usable, we refund $10.  Minor editing (e.g., fixing typos,
reordering phrases, etc.) and repeats will not count against you.  It is
hoped that a discount of this nature will encourage quality
submissions; please read Marc Swisdak's ACF Question Writing Guidelines
(available <A HREF="../acf/acfguide.html">here</A>) to assist you in preparing
your packet.

<LI>Difficulty level will be between ACF Regionals and Nationals.

<LI>The Terrapin has consistently featured geographically diverse teams.

<LI>Tournament format will be round-robin.  If bracketing is necessary,
there will be a playoff round-robin similar to ACF Nationals.

<LI>Unlike most other tournaments, there will be trophies for the winning
team and the runner-up.

<LI>Monetary awards can be given in cash or by check to avoid
bureaucracy.

</UL>

Question packets will be sold subject to the condition that they may not
be placed on any archive site, photocopied, or redistributed without the
express written authorization of the Maryland Academic Quiz Team for a
period of one year.<P>
