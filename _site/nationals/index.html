    <p><strong>ACF Nationals</strong> is the ACF collegiate national championship. For over 25 years, ACF Nationals has been the ultimate test of collegiate quizbowl teams’ skill on the best question set of the year.</p>

<h2 id="acf-nationals-2020">ACF Nationals 2020</h2>
<p>ACF Nationals 2020 will be held on the weekend of <strong>April 18th, 2020 at University of Minnesota - Twin Cities</strong>. You can find the HSQB forum announcement <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=23261">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ryan Westbrook, alumnus of the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, will be head editor.</p>

<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>

<p>The submitted packet and final packet distributions for ACF Nationals (and other ACF tournaments) may be found <a href="/distribution">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="qualifying-for-acf-nationals">Qualifying for ACF Nationals</h2>
<p><a href="/regionals">ACF Regionals</a> serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available <a href="/nationals-qualification">here</a>. As with any ACF tournament, failing to play off or award any applicable Undergraduate and Division II titles at Regionals will incur a penalty (see <a href="/hosting-guidelines/#penalties-for-egregious-hosting-violations">Penalties</a>). In the event that a host’s failure to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2 id="packet-submission">Packet Submission</h2>
<p>The editors of ACF Nationals are planning on writing 12 packets this year. Like the past two ACF Nationals, packet submission will be optional for ACF Nationals this year. The editors of ACF Nationals will work with teams interested in submitting to arrange packet submission, looking to get around 15 submissions for 10 total submitted packets. Please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/TZ8SxgN3ycKFDALt7">this form</a> if you would like to submit a packet.</p>

<p>Under this arrangement, packet submission will not be mandatory, but we’re counting on teams capable of writing quality packets to work with us to ensure that we have enough submissions to edit the tournament. If we can’t be sure that we’ll have enough packets to make this work, we’ll consider other options.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you submit a packet before registering for the tournament and subsequently do not attend ACF Nationals, whether because you do not qualify or because you choose not to attend, that packet can still be used for ACF Nationals. The discount the packet would have earned will roll over to the next ACF tournament that the school sends a team to. If the discount is greater than $70 (<a href="/hosting-guidelines/#financial-breakdown-between-hosts-and-acf">ACF’s share of tournament fees</a>), it can be spread among multiple teams from the same school, or the difference between $70 and the amount of the discount can be rolled over to a further tournament. Rolling over a discount does not preclude submitting a packet for the next ACF tournament, should that be required.</p>

<h2 id="fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</h2>
<p>The base fee for ACF Nationals 2020 is $350.</p>

<ul>
  <li>-$100 packet submission discount: packet submitted by <strong>Sunday, January 19</strong></li>
  <li>-$50 packet submission discount: packet submitted by <strong>Sunday, February 23</strong></li>
  <li>-$25 packet submission discount: packet submitted by <strong>Sunday, March 15</strong></li>
  <li>Buzzer discount: -$10 per working system</li>
  <li>Staffer discount: -$100 for each staffer capable of reading a round in 35 minutes or less</li>
</ul>

<p>All packet submission deadlines are at 11:59pm Central Time on the given day. We will continue to offer an additional $50 dollar discount to any team that submits a packet with almost all questions usable with little to no editing.</p>

<h2 id="field-size">Field Size</h2>
<p>The field for ACF Nationals 2020 is 48 teams.</p>

<h2 id="staffing">Staffing</h2>
<p>If you would like to staff ACF Nationals, please send an email both to <a href="mailto:td@acf-quizbowl.com">td@acf-quizbowl.com</a> and <a href="mailto:staffing@acf-quizbowl.com">staffing@acf-quizbowl.com</a> with the subject line “ACF Nationals staffing”.</p>
