<h2 id="2022-acf-nationals">2022 ACF Nationals</h2>
<p><a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=25391">2022 ACF Nationals</a> will be held on April 9–10, 2022, at the University of Minnesota, in Blegen Hall and Willey Hall on “West Bank.”</p>

<p>2022 ACF Nationals is head edited by John Lawrence. Will Alston, Stephen Eltinge, Stephen Liu, Eric Mukherjee, and Adam Silverman are editors.</p>

<p>Michael Kearney will be Tournament Director.</p>

<p>The field cap for the tournament will be 54 teams.</p>

<!-- More details about packet submission, fees, field size, and staffing will be available in the coming months. -->

<h3 id="covid-19-precautions">COVID-19 precautions</h3>
<p>Attendees of ACF Nationals — whether players, staffers, or spectators — must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and submit proof to that effect. ACF’s definition of “fully vaccinated” will be the CDC’s definition on March 1, 2022, so players may be required to receive boosters if CDC guidelines decide it appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="qualifying-for-acf-nationals">Qualifying for ACF Nationals</h2>
<p><a href="/regionals">ACF Regionals</a> serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available <a href="/nationals-qualification">here</a>.</p>

<p>If an ACF Regionals host fails to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles, or an event precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3 id="qualification-changes-for-2022">Qualification changes for 2022</h3>
<p>In 2022, ACF will allow online ACF Regionals sites to operate as full qualifiers for 2022 ACF Nationals, functioning identically to in-person sites. Winners of online sites and winners of the undergraduate championship at online sites (presuming at least four total undergraduate teams from at least two total schools are present) will earn automatic qualification to ACF Nationals, with all other participating teams being entered into the A-value list for at-large qualification. <!-- This was announced on January 14, 2022. --></p>

<p>Players at online ACF Regionals sites will be required to follow ACF’s new <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8uR9u6WDe-A3H2aqHTLkaVQvivprgfsICYt1G6C8Rs/edit">integrity policy for online play</a>.
<!-- todo: make that doc into static page, under /policies/ --></p>

<h2 id="a-values">A-values</h2>
<p>The A-values for qualification for 2022 ACF Nationals are located <a href="/a-values">here</a>. That page will also serve as a running field list of the teams attending 2022 ACF Nationals.</p>

<p>Teams that have accepted their bid can also now officially register for 2022 ACF Nationals with <a href="https://forms.gle/doeAzE6TvPytdSex6">this form</a>.</p>

<h2 id="packet-submission">Packet submission</h2>
<p>The editors of ACF Nationals are planning on writing 13 packets this year. Like the past three ACF Nationals, packet submission will be optional for ACF Nationals this year. The editors of ACF Nationals will work with teams interested in submitting to arrange packet submission, looking to get enough team submissions to make 10 total submitted packets.</p>

<p>Finalized tossups for 2022 ACF Nationals will be capped at 8 lines in 10-point Times New Roman. However, this cap does not apply to submissions; submitting teams are allowed and encouraged to submit longer tossups.</p>

<p>Like previous years, packet submission will not be mandatory, but we’re counting on teams capable of writing quality packets to work with us to ensure that we have enough submissions to edit the tournament. If we can’t be sure that we’ll have enough packets to make this work, we’ll consider other options.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you submit a packet before registering for the tournament and subsequently do not attend ACF Nationals, whether because you do not qualify or because you choose not to attend, that packet can still be used for ACF Nationals. The discount the packet would have earned will roll over to the next ACF tournament that the school sends a team to. If the discount is greater than $70 (ACF’s share of tournament fees), it can be spread among multiple teams from the same school, or the difference between $70 and the amount of the discount can be rolled over to a further tournament. Rolling over a discount does not preclude submitting a packet for the next ACF tournament, should that be required.</p>

<p><strong>New this year:</strong> teams will be required to declare their intent to submit a packet for a particular deadline two weeks in advance in order to receive that deadline’s discount. This will enable the editors to properly forecast and plan workloads. Teams should fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/mZd9yzJVSXDC8Jok8">this form</a> to declare their intent to submit a packet for a particular deadline.</p>

<p>All packet submission deadlines are at 11:59 p.m. Central Time. Packets must be submitted to <a href="mailto:nationals@acf-quizbowl.com">nationals@acf-quizbowl.com</a>. We will continue to offer an additional −$50 quality discount to any team that submits a polished packet with almost all questions usable with little to no editing.</p>
