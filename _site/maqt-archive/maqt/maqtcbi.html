COLLEGE PARK, MD--20-year-old Josh Allen, president-elect of the Maryland Academic Quiz 
Team, has announced that the team will reaffiliate with College Bowl, Inc., for the 
1999-2000 season, after a ten-year absence.</P>

"There has been a change in the leadership of the MAQT," Allen explained. "We have 
suffered too long under the brutal tyranny of the mind-numbing ACF format."</P>

<P>Josh gained the presidency over incumbent Julie Singer in the recent elections as head of 
the "White and Yellow" party. His first act was an order to confiscate all copies of 
<CITE>Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia</CITE>, <CITE>Janson's History of Art</CITE>, and other reference books of an 
academic nature. After careful consultation with his advisors, Allen decided to allow 
players to possess <CITE>An Incomplete Education</CITE> due to its "What You Need to Know to Meet Your 
Date's Parents" section. Each freshman was then given a copy of the <CITE>1999 World Almanac</CITE>
and a one-year subscription to <CITE>Newsweek</CITE>.</P>

<P>As part of the $300 "starter kit" for new schools, the MAQT will receive unlimited use 
of the www.collegebowl.com website, a catalog of custom prize merchandise, and the College 
Bowl Program Guide.</P>

<P>"We are very pleased with the University of Maryland's decision to reenroll into the CBI 
community," College Bowl President Richard Reid said. "During the last ten years, I often 
felt sorry for the students at Maryland who had no outlet for quiz bowl competition 
because of their decision to deaffiliate from College Bowl. Since the opportunity to play 
College Bowl was available for the low cost of $600 per year, I can only wonder why it 
took them so long to return."</P>

<P>The real history of the team was unknown to all but a certain few of its members until a 
few months ago. Through players like Matt Colvin, freshmen were indoctrinated into the 
Sacred Teachings of the <CITE>Vish-Nu</CITE>. According to the <CITE>Vish-Nu</CITE>, after a period of strife known 
as the "Great Flame War," the team was formed in 1990 when a golden buzzer system came 
down to Ramesh Kannapan from the sky. Ramesh and his pupils John Nam and Carol Guthrie 
formed the Academic Competition Foundation in order to spread the Word. After seventy-two 
days, seventy-two players had compiled texts of all known ACF knowledge. Miraculously, 
all players had prepared one identical book, now commonly known as <CITE>Benet's</CITE>. This hallowed 
text is bestowed upon each team member after he can recite all of the definitions in the 
team lexicon.</P>

<P>Earlier this year, 17-year-old freshman Chad Groft, while rummaging through the bottom of 
a box of questions, discovered an odd assortment of yellow and white papers which had been 
carelessly left behind by alumnus Arthur Fleming. Groft took these questions to freshman 
practice, where they were heard by other younger players.</P>

Groft related, "Dave [Hamilton] had chastised us at the previous practice after no one 
answered a tossup on <CITE>Michael Kolhaas</CITE>, by Heinrich von Kleist. He told us that we would 
never amount to anything if we couldn't distinguish between Kleist's major works, and if 
we couldn't recognize the titles of his lesser known plays and key events in his life as 
related by <CITE>Benet's</CITE>. He also told us not to bother coming back next week if we hadn't 
memorized his birth and death dates. I talked to my English professor, and he had never 
even heard of Kleist. When we read these from the strange yellow papers, I found that I 
had actually heard of some of the answers, and noticed that most of them related to 
real life. For instance, one tossup entreated us to name a curved, yellow, fruit, and I 
instantly buzzed in with the correct answer. I have first-hand knowledge of bananas, and 
have even eaten them on occasion, usually in delicious candy form. In addition, I have 
enjoyed the music of <CITE>Bananarama</CITE>, and the goofy hijinks of <CITE>Bananas in Pajamas</CITE> and the 
<CITE>Banana Splits</CITE>. Any format which can connect with so many facets of the human experience 
must be superior to ACF."</P>

<P>Groft added, "I bet Kleist ate bananas."</P>

<P>The radical ideas of players like Groft led to subversive demonstrations against ACF 
at practice, including the reading of so-called "trash" questions, on topics which 
could be answered without the usual 4-5 years of intense study required to successfully 
get questions at tournaments like the Terrapin. In February, freshman Patrick Schmahl 
derisively chanted "List! List!" while senior Zeke Berdichevsky was rattling off answers 
in a title-author bonus from a 1997 Tennessee Masters packet. Patrick was quickly escorted 
from the room and silenced, but the effects were devastating.</P>

<P>Graduate student Michael Starsinic expressed his dismay at the results of the recent 
election. "The consequences of Josh's reforms are all too apparent. Just yesterday, 
I asked [freshman] Andy Hu who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1989, and he laughed 
and cruelly mocked me. I shudder to think about the state of the MAQT when players no 
longer have respect for cultural icons like Trygve Haavelmo."</P>

<P>Julie Singer was unavailable for comment, as she had not finished memorizing her list 
of the 50 most important Sumerian Love Poets.</P>
