<H2><A NAME="masters"></A>Tennessee Masters</H2>

We sent one team to Tennessee Masters, the yearly tournament where the quiz
bowl canon expands faster than William Conrad at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
As the "Neg-erzz with Attitudez," we finished with a 7-5 record, including a
win over the Legion of Superheroes. Matt Colvin was "MC Neg," David Hamilton
was "Grandbiscuit B," Dave Goodman was "Ice Queef," and Arthur Fleming was
"Dr. A".<P>

The Fine Arthurs placed third at Philly Experiment with a 17-3 record,
despite abandoning their original team name, "Arthur 4: On the Buzzers."
Instead of the usual specious all-Dave team, we gave in to the minority with
the all-Arthur team. Dave Goodman was "Artarino," Dave Hamilton was the
"Artinator," Dave Vacca was "Art-o-rama," and Arthur Fleming was the
"Artmeister."<P>

<H2><A NAME="RMC">Randolph-Macon Harvest Bowl</A></H2>

I said in the <A HREF="upcoming.html">Upcoming Events</A> page that this
was guaranteed to be the most interesting tournament of the season, and I
was right for the wrong reasons. The harvest was quite lean this year at
Randolph-Macon. The moderators were below average, and it was painfully
evident that they had not been trained to handle the difficulties of
switching formats.  The declining quality of the questions during the
tournament was explained after lunch when it became evident that most of
the remaining tournament questions had not been written. At this point,
the tournament broke down faster that Lithium 5, as much of the field
packed up and left. Statistics from this tournament will not be counted as
official, so I won't even bother putting them up. The high points of the
tournament were the free lunch at R-M's dining hall, and Maryland's
impromptu game of fruitball played during one of the long waits we had.
Fruitball is very similar to baseball, except it is played with a tree
branch and an unidentified unripe, rough-skinned green fruit that
explodes on contact with a hard object. A Randolph-Macon team member
thought that they were persimmons, but this identification is doubtful.
Before all our fruits were destroyed, Dave Goodman and RG both got one
hit, and Arthur Fleming had two.<P>

<H2><A NAME="JHU">Johns Hopkins</A></H2>

The questions were decent at JHU, and anything had to be better after
the first tournament of the year. The first team won, and the second
team lost in the semifinals to GWU 270-255.<P>

<H2><A NAME="PSU">Penn State Nittany Lion</A></H2>
The questions here varied from acceptable to weird to bad. A good rule of
thumb derived from this tournament is that starting a packet with
five history questions is generally not a good idea, especially when
it is the first packet of the tournament. Things got better after that
minor Pickarillo, until the semifinals, where we lost to Ohio State,
composed of former MAQT player Michael Starsinic and his impressive
teammates.<P>

<H3>MD A-Team</H3>
The A team decided to call itself the A-team, much to my chagrin. Let's
look at the casting:<P>
<DL>
<DT>Arthur Fleming: Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith
<DD><EM>Casting is doubtful. Does not smoke cigars. Did not use witticisms
like "I love it when a bonus comes together" during the tournament. Better
choices: The soldier who is always driving Col. Decker around, or better
yet, Carla, the woman who gives General Stockwell folders.</EM>
<DT>Dave Hamilton: Captain H.M. "Howling Mad" Murdock
<DD><EM>A little better. Says weird things, but usually not Murdockian in
nature. Outlook on life more similar to Murdock in "MacGyver." Should have
been "Dishpan" Frankie or General Fulbright.</EM>
<DT>Jesse Molesworth: Lt. Templeton "Face" Peck (aka Richard Bancroft)
<DD><EM>Good choice. Does not seem to have a scheming nature, and seems more
similar to the first-episode Tim Dunigan Face. Not nearly annoying enough
to be Tawnia, the second choice.</EM>
<DT>Adam Fine: Sergeant Bosco "B.A." Baracus
<DD><EM>I pity the fool who thinks that Adam would be a good B.A. Although
he yelled at Murdock several times during the tournament, his heart wasn't
in it. Would make a good Amy Allen or Col. Decker, however.</EM>

Ahh, Georgetown Cup. Probably the closest thing that we ivory-tower

we made the trek to DC to experience the worst questions of the year. Maryland
A went undefeated in the round robin, and beat all the other teams in the
playoffs by at least 200 points. We promptly lost in the semifinals to GWU,
so Maryland could not defend its title. We would give our trophy from last
year to Princeton if we had gotten one. At least we learned some <A

<H3>Maryland Young-UMCP</H3>
An all-freshman team, Maryland Young went 10-2 to finish second in the round
robin. Due to the highly scientific single-elim playoffs, they were knocked
out of contention by Princeton in the semifinals.<P>

<H3>Maryland A</H3>
This team roared through the prelims, going
undefeated at 11-0 and slaughtering John Sheahan's one-man "Lincoln Tech"
team.  Alas, they met questions by the inheritor of the Tom Joint, Andrew
Yaphe, in the playoffs, losing two low-scoring games to Georgia Tech by
ten points each and finishing second to Tech overall.<P>

<H3>Maryland B</H3>
With the defection of Julie to the Penn State
"Llamaspotting" team, Maryland B called on its resident Cincinnatus, Dave
Vacca, to bring it respectability.  After three rounds, it was sucking all
kinds of bad, as the B team won a forfeit over Princeton but was crushed
by Georgia Tech and Illinois.  However, Vacca did not disappoint, as
Maryland B closed by winning 11 of its last 12 games, finishing 5th
overall, including a 150-point, last-seven toss-up comeback against Martin
Poteralski's UNC team.<P>

<H3>Maryland C</H3>
Normally a team with Khon as its captain would not
induce fear in many opponents.  However, this weekend Khon proved to be
"The Enforcer," as he had back-to-back career games of 5-0 and 4-0 in
dispatching Methodist 195-0 and Virginia Tech B.  A victory over the
Virginia frosh in the playoffs gave Maryland C a 3-11 record overall.<P>

<H3>Maryland Wilde Maus</H3>
All three team names were for roller
coasters you would find at Busch Gardens, where the MAQT went the day
after Wahoo.  Wilde Maus (named after the kiddie coaster) featured the
dominance of David Hamilton, who had a 14-0 game on Adam's packet.  Its
only two losses were to Princeton A, both by 40 points or less, the second
time in the semifinals.

<H3>Maryland Big Bad Wolf</H3>
This team had a devastating one-two doubleteam punch
in Arthur and Julie, the 2nd and 3rd scorers of the tournament.  Only a
surprising loss to Penn kept Big Bad Wolf from going undefeated.  Sadly,
they met the asslucky champion Pitt the Elder team in the semis, who won
on the last toss-up.<P>

The third Maryland playoff team, at 10-2 its
losses in the prelims were to Princeton A and Pitt A by a combined 50
points.  Having a chance to exact revenge on Pitt in the quarterfinals,
they fell short by only 10 points when Joe Wright purposely ran out the
clock with an incorrect buzz.<P>

In the aftermath of the <A HREF="#RMC">Harvest Bowl</A>
disaster, Randolph-Macon started to return to respectability by hosting a
five-team freshman/sophomore tourney, with R-MC, UMBC, and UMCP.  Bogus
Journey proved to be the dominant team of the tournament, going undefeated
and winning the $100 first prize.  Its wins over the 2nd place team, UMBC
A, included a thrilling 200-195 comeback and a 480-10 thrashing.<P>

With Dave Goodman unable to attend the Illinois trek
because of GRE's, the A team relied on Matt Colvin to pick up some of the
slack.  All things considered, Maryland A played well, losing only to
Illinois in the prelims and finishing third overall behind Virginia and
Chicago.<P>

<H3>Maryland B</H3>
Presented the schedule from hell on Night One, the B
team fell to Illinois B, Virginia A, and Iowa State A before pulling a
stunning upset over Cal-Berkeley to keep Cal from the playoffs.  The win
was on the last toss-up, when Adam pulled a science question on
Gauss!  Maryland B recovered from a 1-4 first night to finish 7-7
overall, good for 15th place.<P>
