<H3>Submission</H3>
Packets can be submitted for ACF Regionals in the following ways, in order of 
preference:<P>
<OL>
<LI>A Microsoft Word file attached to email to dhamiltn@wam.umd.edu
<LI>An RTF file
<LI>Some other PC word processor format which preserves emboldening or 
underlining (Works, Wordperfect, etc.)
<LI>Plain text attachment (much less preferable than above)
</UL>

Packets can be submitted for ACF nationals in the following ways, in order of 
preference:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Over email to achou@midway.uchicago.edu, in RTF format
<LI>Over email to achou@midway.uchicago.edu, in Microsoft Word format
<LI>Over email as any other attached word processor file
<LI>Over email as attached plain text
<LI>Over email as a regular email message (definitely not preferred)

Please note that I greatly prefer any kind of attached file, since I'd rather 
not spend hours removing line breaks from email messages.<P>

When sending your packet, please indicate clearly which school and which team 
from that school is submitting the packet.  You should send tossups and bonuses 
together in a single message, with each section marked with the school name
and team, i.e. Chicago A Tossups, Chicago A Bonuses. In addition, please 
indicate the author(s) of the packet.<P>

Printouts of a packet will <STRONG>not</STRONG> be accepted.<P>

Do not number your questions.<P>

You need not label questions with their subject area.<P>

For the purposes of discounts, a packet will not be considered as submitted 
unless it meets the requirements specified in this document.<P>

<H3>Formatting</H3>

Individual questions should follow the following formats (note that these 
questions should not be taken as representative of the style or content 
expected, only of the formatting):<P>

<PRE>
Tossups by Edwards U. (Alice Chou and Wallace)

Born December 4, 1972 in Pennsylvania, he attended school
next door to the Barnes Foundation.  After four years at the
University of Chicago, during which he was often drunk and
occasionally seen wearing his underwear backwards, he
attended law school at Howard University and appeared on
_Burden of Proof_ to discuss John Wayne Gacy's brain.  FTP,
name this employee of the Cook County District Attorney's
office and editor of the 1999 ACF National Tournament.
        Answer:  John J. _Edwards_, Jr.
</PRE><P>
Notice that the tossup is not numbered, and that the essential information is 
underscored and not capitalized (it would be emboldened or underlined instead of 
underscored if in a better word processor format, though). Also, the book title 
in the tossup body is marked with underscores (italicization would be 
preferable).

</PRE><P>

Hopefully these examples are self-explanatory enough.  A few
notes:<P>

Please, no line breaks within question text!<P>

The answer to a question or question part should immediately
follow that question.  Do not skip lines between the question
and its answer or between parts of the same bonus.<P>

The word "Answer" should be spelled out, not abbreviated, and
indented with one tab.<P>

Don't forget to embolden, underline or _underscore_ the essential
information in the answer.(If you're sending an RTF or word
processor file, do not use underscoring.) Whichever method you choose, please
be consistent throughout the packet, and <STRONG>do not</STRONG> also capitalize 
the essential information.<P>

Book titles, paintings, law cases, and similar information in the body of the 
question should be italicized (or underscored if italicization isn't possible). 
Names of poems, nicknames, and other information which is typically enclosed in 
double quotes should be so.<P>

You should also indicate alternate answers and what partial answers can
be prompted on.<P>

Pronunciation guides are encouraged for words that may be difficult.<P>

In bonuses, indicate clearly how much each bonus part is worth in the style 
shown above (and, of course, each bonus must be worth a total of 30 points).<P>

I don't care what font or what size margins you use. (Dave prefers that you use 
10 point Times New Roman if you have it).<P>

If you have any questions about formatting, feel free to contact Alice Chou 
(achou@midway.uchicago.edu).<P>
