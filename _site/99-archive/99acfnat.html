<H1>1999 ACF Nationals Announcement</H1>
</CENTER>

ACF hereby officially announces the 1999 ACF National Championship
Tournament, to be held at The University of Chicago on April 23-24, 1999.
Various pieces of information follow, including editing/packet info,
registration info, fees, travel info, and other miscellany.

<H2>Editing/Packets</H2>
This year's NCT will be (as always) a packet submission tournament. The
editing team (and it is a _team_, as opposed to last year's "top-heavy"
model) is being led by John Edwards and Rick Grimes, and includes several
former ACF editors and/or champions.<P>

All packets must be sent to Alice Chou, Assistant Tournament Editor at 
achou@midway.uchicago.edu. Any packet sent to Alice that does not meet the tournament 
formatting guidelines will be returned to the submitting party immediately. Any packet
that does not meet the tournament question category distribution will be
returned to the submitting party immediately. A packet will not be considered
"submitted" in terms of discounts and deadlines until it meets the required
specifications. Any returned packet will be sent back with specific
instructions how to cure any defects in the packet.<P>

"B" teams are required to submit packets as well. However, if there is
space for any "C" teams, such teams will not be required to submit a packet.<P>

Any questions regarding packet requirements should be directed to Rick
Grimes (RiGrimes@aol.com) and John Edwards (Jedwards72@aol.com), Editors-in-Chief.
Formatting questions directed to Alice Chou (achou@midway.uchicago.edu). Any
questions about tournament logistics and registration should be sent to Mike
Zarren (mikez@tiac.net).<P>

We urge all teams to read John Sheahan's thorough and insightful Question
Writing Supplement for the 1998 ACF National Tournament. The directors of
the 1999 Championship adopt this document in its entirety. The Sheahan guidelines 
can be found <A HREF="writers.html">here</A>.<P>

Teams should also read the new <A HREF="formatting.html">ACF Formatting Guidelines</A>. 
Packets are required to follow these guidelines.

<H2>Format</H2>
The format for this tournament will depend on the number of teams attending,
but expect a field split into divisional round robins with teams advancing
to playoff RRs, as in previous years. I expect the tournament to begin with
a meeting around 6:30 & rounds at 7 on Friday. Saturday will likely have
rounds starting at 9, and I expect to be done by 5:30. All times subject to
change, though. (I promise we will not start earlier than 6 on Fri.)

<H2>Registration</H2>
This tournament is limited by space and other resources to 30 teams. If we
have fewer than 30 teams registered (that is, registrations _received,_ not
necessarily sent) by 11:59:59CST Jan 31, then registration will become
first-come, first-served until we fill up. If we have more than 30, first
teams from schools will be accepted first. After that, B (and perhaps C)
teams will be accepted based upon the old ACF system of finish results at
ACF format invitationals and regionals. (More on this system later if you
need it; it basically will consist of us looking at how your teams have done
at other ACF format tourneys, especially Regionals.)<P>

If teams have sent in a packet before Jan 31 but are, for some reason, not
allowed to participate, the packet will be returned to them & not used in
the tournament. This is possible, but unlikely.<P>

This system seems to us to be the fairest way to let the broadest number of
schools into the tourney while not compromising quality amongst B-teams,
etc.<P>

TO REGISTER, do the following: send an email to mikez@tiac.net with
"ACF REG" in the subject line & an appropriate message in the body saying
what school's team(s) you're registering. Do not put "ACF REG" in the
subject unless you are registering; for questions and other email info
please see below. Please do not register a team unless you are relatively certain
it will be attending. If you're going to be claiming any moderator or buzzer
discounts, please also let us know (either when you register or later) at
the same address/subject. I will attempt to confirm receipt of all
registration emails within one week. If you've heard nothing back after that
time, please contact me again.

<H2>Travel</H2>
Chicago is easy & (relatively) cheap to get to from almost anywhere
in the country. Midway airport is closer to campus than O'Hare is. Taxis
from Midway are ~$20 and take about 25min; from O'Hare it's more like $50
and ~1hour. Public transportation is available from both airports to campus;
feel free to ask me about it later. There <STRONG>will</STRONG> be parking available in the
neighborhood for teams who drive or rent (or both) a car.

<H2>Hotel</H2>
We have reserved a block of rooms at the Ramada Inn Lake Shore, the only
hotel in the area. I believe the rate is $85+taxes. To get in on this block,
call 1-800-237-4933 during CST business hours and ask to speak with Marilyn.
Tell her you are with the College Bowl group (Yes, I know this is amusing.
But to get the University rate, we had to give the name of our University
organization, and that's it).<P>

In terms of getting from the hotel to campus, the hotel has a small shuttle
but if enough teams need it, we will arrange a larger bus to get you from
there to here (it is about 13 blocks); I will be taking a survey for this as
the tourney approaches (do not email me now). If you're bringing a car,
there's parking both at the tourney site & at the hotel, so you should be
fine.<P>

If you need other travel info, feel free to email me; I will be sending out
a more detailed transportation info email to registered teams once I have
the hotel squared away (or not).<P>

<H2>Questions?</H2>
If you have further questions, feel free to email me at
mikez@tiac.net - please put "ACF Question" in the subject line. Thank you.<P>

Thanks,<BR>
