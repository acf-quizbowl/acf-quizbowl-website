<CITE>...hardcore ACF...</CITE> -- countless writers on
qb@iastate.edu.<BR>
<CITE>...hardcore, f***-your-mother ACF...</CITE> -- Guy Jordan<BR>
<CITE>...brain-twisting, bullet-sweating, hardcore ACF
depth-of-knowledge-fests...</CITE> -- James Rogers<P>

In case you weren't aware, ACF has a reputation.  And, though I love the
format dearly, I'm afraid it is probably a deserved reputation.  I was
tempted to suggest that the new ACF organization be called "Hardcore,
Inc."  Our web page would have gotten more hits that way.<P>

But seriously, ACF is played by some of the most wild-eyed quiz bowl
addicts in all the land.  They like their questions unadulterated, neat,
80-proof, and academic.  A side-effect is that the questions they write
are often hard.  Too hard, perhaps, for novices.<P>

There are really two ways to solve this problem, and I think both can be
employed.  To put it bluntly, we can get rid of the hard questions, or we
can get rid of the novices.  I recommend a little of both.  First, ACF
writers and editors need to make an effort to keep difficulty at a
reasonable level.  This means that when I edit ACF Regionals this year, I
will be asking, for every tossup, "Will this be answered by two
medium-level teams by the end of the question?"  And for every bonus,
"Would a .500 team in one of this year's regions get 10-20 points on
this?"  If the answer is no, then I'm going to do a little surgery.<P>

I don't know what John Sheahan's method will be when he edits ACF
Nationals, but he's given himself a whole semester to do it, so I expect
good things from him.<P>

The other way to change ACF's hardcore nature is to make the medium-level
team better.  I think ACF would be more fun for everyone if more teams
were good at it.  Why do we play quiz bowl instead of just watching
Jeopardy?  Because it's <STRONG>more fun</STRONG> to answer questions than
it is to watch other people answer them.  "So," you ask, "how can my team
answer more questions?"  Earlier this year, a friend of mine from high
school, now at another college, asked me just this.<P>

Now, I am far from considering myself a great player.  But I don't think
it's necessary to be one to answer my friend's question.  So I offer my
answer in all humility (a quality I have acquired in good measure after
playing next to Eric Tentarelli for a few tournaments this fall).  Take it
for what it is: the story of how the 1996-7 Maryland A team got good, and
how you, the older player or coach, can get your young players to do the
same:<P>

The first thing is to lay out "how it is."  Make it clear that almost
nobody comes to the table knowing hard ACF clues.  Point out that every
good ACF player was once a bad one (with very few exceptions).  If your
team looks up to you, point out that you didn't know hard ACF clues when
you started playing.<P>

Second, stress the value of work.  Point out that it can be a lot of fun
to learn the information, to memorize the lists, to write the questions. 
Add that it definitely helps in other formats: no good ACF team is a bad
NAQT or CBI team, though some good CBI teams are bad ACF ones.  This is a
simple function of the distribution -- ACF's subject areas (e.g.
philosophy, mythology) are a subset of NAQT's or CBI's, even if ACF's
canon (e.g.  Fichte, Melampus) isn't a subset of NAQT's canon.<P>

If your club's best players are all industrious and have a hard-working
approach to the game, the young players will emulate them without any
slave-driving.  This is how it worked at Maryland when I was there.
Everything was voluntary, even if strongly encouraged.<P>

Do not start out your new players with hard questions.  Read easy ACF
questions, from a juniorbird tournament or even a high school tournament. 
Read questions from years past -- 1993 or 94 Nationals is not too hard
(last year's hard clues become this year's giveaways).  Regionals would
work OK too.  Do <STRONG>not</STRONG> read this year's Terrapin or last
year's Wahoo War or Tennessee Masters.  Those tournaments were targeted at
experienced players.  They are too hard.<P>

Make sure players have books and use them. I bought Benet's Reader's
Encyclopedia for one player here at Cornell, and gave my Cambridge
Biographical Encyclopedia to another.  A third got a similar reference
book.  Encourage your players to write questions and bring them to
practice to read.  Tell them to write ACF-style questions <EM>on things
they have heard come up</EM>.<P>

Give your players list-memorizing programs.  Do a net search for
"Flash'em", a Mac flash-card program for memorizing lists.  If you can't
find it, I can send it to you.  Make lists yourself and give them to your
players to memorize.<P>

Encourage players to work together.  When I was a sophomore, David
Hamilton, Arthur Fleming, and I held 3-man practices in addition to the
ones the team held.  We kept notebooks and wrote down lead-in clues.  I
still keep a notebook and write down things I know I should know, but
don't.<P>

If you have a decent-sized collection of old questions, you can hand out
old tournaments to players to read on their own time and take notes on, to
"comb" for good lead-in clues.<P>

Hold a separate practice for younger/non-A team players.  Though Dave
Hamilton, Dave Goodman, Arthur Fleming and I were not given this
opportunity, we created it for ourselves, and later provided it to the
freshman class in 1996-7.  Eventually, this should be phased out and young
players should run with the big dogs in the regular practice.  But it is a
good idea for a year.<P>

It helps if players bond with their teammates.  My sophmore and junior
years, Arthur, Dave, Dave, and I really saw ourselves as the future
Maryland A team, and we often practiced together and kept each other
accountable in learning lists, apart from the rest of the club.  We really
thought we could win Nationals in 1996 or 97.  As it turns out, we weren't
good enough, but we came close.  Encourage your freshmen to work together
and play together, or with the sophmores.  This way, they can be strategic
about what they learn for the long term.<P>

It helps if players are competitive with each other.  David Hamilton and I
had a little rivalry in art history for a while (before he learned it
better and started kicking my butt).  As a result, Maryland B in 1994 was
one of the best teams in the nation on that subject.  A little friendly
rivalry can be an excellent motivation.  Practices can be competitive and
still be laid-back.<P>

Finally, encourage your players to write questions.  Some of the circuit's
best players are also its most prolific writers (no, Chip Beall is not one
of them).<P>

This is how it is done.  There is no royal road to becoming a better
player.  But if the road were quick and easy, it wouldn't be so much
fun.<P>

ACF is trying harder to make itself more accessible.  ACF Regionals will
be easier, cheaper, and more attractive this year than ever.  If you're a
better player, you'll have more fun -- and not only at ACF tournaments.<P>
