<H1>ACF-Format Question Writing Supplement</H1>
Prepared by John Sheahan for the ACF-Format National Championship
Tournament, 1998.<BR>
Version 1.0<BR>
HTMLized by David Hamilton<P>
<HR>
<P>
This memorandum is intended as a supplement to the <A
HREF="acfguide.html">Swisdak ACF Question-Writing Guide</A>. All teams
planning on submitting a packet for ACF-format nationals should be
familiar with both documents, and should carefully observe all the
rules they contain.  However, in the event of a conflict between
this document and the Swisdak guidelines, the supplement will
control.<P>

Few of the rules in here are absolute. Consistency between packets
is absolutely necessary for any format, but preserving the
individual style of different team-written packets is also
important. With the exception of the category distributions (which
are fairly loose to begin with) and the deadlines (which are not),
minor deviations from these rules will be tolerated so long as they
comply with the underlying spirit of the format.<P>

This is a very preliminary document. Any suggestions or criticisms
are very welcome.<P>

<H2>General Rules and Deadlines</H2>

All packets should contain 30 tossups, and 30 bonus questions.<P>

<H3>Submission</H3>
Packets can be submitted for ACF nationals in the following ways, in order
of preference:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Over e-mail to jsheahan@midway.uchicago.edu, in WordPerfect 5.1 format
<LI>Over e-mail to jsheahan@midway.uchicago.edu, in ASCII format
<LI>On a 3.5 IBM-formatted disc in either WP51 or ASCII, mailed to:<BR>
John Sheahan, 1606 E. 50th Pl. #3-A, Chicago, IL 60615.
</OL>

Printouts of a packet will _not_ be accepted.<P>

<H3>Deadlines</H3>
Deadlines for packet submission are as follows:

<PRE>
Earliest deadline ($30 discount)- December 20, 1997
Early deadline ($10 discount) - January 31, 1998
Regular deadline (no discount) - February 15, 1998
Latest deadline (maximum $40 penalty) - March 17, 1998
</PRE>

No packets will be accepted after March 17, 1998.  Although a team
may still participate in ACF-format Nationals if this deadline is
missed, it will be assessed a $70 penalty for failing to submit a
packet.

<H3>Submission Requirements</H3>
For the purposes of discounts, a packet will not be
considered as submitted unless it meets the requirements specified
in this document.  Although we will be willing to overlook minor
errors, a packet which shows a clear disregard for these rules will
be returned.<P>

If an answer contains non-essential words, the essential
parts should be indicated like _this_.  Examples: The Treaty of
_Utrecht_, _T_heodore _Roosevelt_, _George III_, Alexandre _Dumas,
fils_.  Try not to over-underline.  For example, if you ask for the
eighteenth president of the United States, only the word _Grant_
should be underlined, since even though there are many famous
people named Grant, only one was a U.S. president.  Underlines are
optional if the answer contains only one word.  However, if the
question contains multiple words and all are essential, underlining
should be used, eg. _Categorical Imperative_.<P>

For the convenience of the writer, a sample packet will be
sent along with this memo.  You should use this as a model for
technical formatting, as well as for general levels of difficulty
and style.  If you are unsure of how to format a particular type of
question, and do not see an example of it in the model packet, send
an e-mail with your question to <A HREF="mailto:jsheahan@midway.uchicago.edu">
John Sheahan</A>.<P>

When submitting your packet, please include at the top the
names (not pseudonyms) of all players who contributed to it.

<H2>Question Distribution and Balance</H2>

This section contains both a simple and a detailed question
distribution.  The simple distribution is designed to give
experienced ACF question-writers the maximum creativity to design
their own packet, while the detailed distribution is designed for
less-experienced question writers, who may be unsure of how to
properly balance a packet within categories.  However, rules <STRONG>
1</STRONG>,
<STRONG>2</STRONG>, and <STRONG>3</STRONG> apply regardless of which option is 
chosen.<P>

<STRONG>1</STRONG>. No packet should contain more than one question from the 
same
narrow subcategory of knowledge, unless both are parts of a single
bonus.  Narrowness should be understood with reference to the
frequency with which such subcategories appear in academic
competition: for example, Japanese literature is a narrow
subcategory, but American literature is not.  However, American
transcendentalist literature would be a narrow subcategory, as
would detective fiction.  Along the same lines, it is fine to have
multiple questions on Physics, but there should not be multiple
questions on particle physics, electricity & magnetism, etc.<P>

Note also that two questions can fit into different category
distributions, and still be considered members of the same narrow
subcategory.  For example, a question on Greek mythology should not
be included in the same packet with a question on the plot of
Homer's _Iliad_.<P>

<STRONG>2</STRONG>. Every packet should contain as diverse a range of subject
matter as possible.  No packet should fill its entire history
requirement with military-political history, American history, or
20th-century history.  Science questions should be balanced between
the history of science and scientific concepts, as well as between
theoretical and applied branches of science.  The detailed
distribution shows one possible means of meeting this diversity
requirement.<P>

<STRONG>3</STRONG>. Questions should be scattered evenly by category through the
packet; all of the literature questions, for example, should not be
in the beginning or the end.  This is especially important for the
bonus section, as not all 20 bonuses will necessarily be reached.<P>

<H3>Simple Distribution</H3>

The tossup and bonus sections of the packet should each follow this
distribution.<P>

</TABLE><P>
* At least one of the ten reserve questions should be either art/film or 
music.<P>
** Should be from different categories. In addition, if there were
five questions written on Literature, History, or Science already,
neither of these miscellaneous questions should be used on another
question from that category.<P>

<H3>Detailed Distribution</H3>
Questions should be allocated between the first twenty and the ten
reserves according to the simple distribution above.<P>

There will be gray areas in all of these categories; problems that
arise from this are left to the writer's best judgment. In
addition, many questions (particularly bonuses) will straddle more
than one category.  In these cases, the writer should assign the
question to a category based on its dominant element.<P>

<UL>
<LI>History- 7 questions total, divided as follows:
<OL>
<LI>North American history since 1945
<LI>North American or world history since 1945
<LI>North American history before 1945
<LI>European history, 1648-1945
<LI>European history, 565-1648
<LI>Ancient history (of any civilization)
<LI>Non-western history or Latin American history
</OL><P>
No more than 2 history questions should be about military history;
no more than 3 should be about political leaders.<P>
<LI>Literature- 7 questions total, divided as follows:
<OL>
<LI>North American literature
<LI>All other English-language literature
<LI>Any English-language literature
<LI>European literature
<LI>European literature (should not be from the same country as #4)
<LI>Non-western, Latin American, or ancient literature
<LI>Any literature
</OL>
<P>
No more than 3 of these should be about writers; no more than 4
should be about novels or novelists.  Questions about King Arthur,
Trojan war characters, etc. should be treated as literature if they
relate to a specific text, but as myth if they do not.
<P>
<LI>Religion, Philosophy, Myth- 3 questions total:
<OL>
<LI>Myth and folklore
<LI>Religion and theology
<LI>Philosophy
</OL>
<P>
<LI>Social Science- 1 question
<P>
Social science includes (but is not limited to) psychology,
economics, anthropology, linguistics, sociology, and political
science.  In a combined packet (tossups and bonuses), each social
science question should relate to a different discipline.
<P>
<LI>Science- 7 questions
<OL>
<LI>Biology and medicine
<LI>Natural history (zoology, paleontology, earth science, etc.)
<LI>Mathematics or astronomy
<LI>Physics or chemistry
<LI>Technology, including Computer Science
<LI>Any of the above
<LI>Any of the above, or another social science
</OL>
<P>
No more than 3 of these should be on the history of science or
biographies of scientists.
<P>
<LI>Art, Architecture, and Film- 1 question
<P>
A combined packet should not contain more than one question each on
architecture and film.  By contrast, it is permissible to fill this
quota entirely with questions on visual art.
<P>
<LI>Music- 1 questions
<P>
No packet should contain more than one "name the composer" tossup.
<P>
<LI>Geography- 1 questions
<P>
These should not be too historical.
<P>
<LI>Any of the above- 2 questions
<P>
This may include purely interdisciplinary questions, extra
questions from the above categories, or questions that do not fit
into any of the above categories.
</UL>

<H3>Recent History</H3>
While there is no separate category for current events, this
does not mean that recent history can never be included in a
packet.  However, if current history is included, it should have
some substance.  As a rule of thumb, a current history is only
acceptable if it is the type of information that is likely to be
remembered ten years from now.  Thus, Laurent Kabila and Maastricht
are both acceptable as question fodder, but Lorena Bobbitt and
Tropical Storm Bob are not.<P>

Also, please remember that this exception is for current _history_,
not current pop culture.

<H3>Literature and Film</H3>
Literature and film are defined here as work that is either
worthy of serious study or of long-lasting significance.  Whether
it is good or bad does not matter, as many notoriously awful
writers (Sade, Bulwer-Lytton) have long been a part of the ACF
canon.  As with current history, recent writers are permissible,
but should be treated with caution.  There is nothing wrong with a
question on the latest offering of Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut,
or Joyce Carol Oates, but topics like Dean Koontz, _Men In Black_,
etc. should be saved for a trash tournament.

<H3>Music</H3>
It is intended that the vast majority of music questions
written deal with western classical music.  However, it is
permissible to write on any other form of "serious" music.  For
example, a jazz question could be used to fill this quota.  And
while there is no hard-line rule against popular music of
established, long-lasting importance (Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson,
etc), camp and nostalgia questions (Spice Girls, Tony Orlando,
Bananarama) should not be included.

<H3>Geography</H3>
The geography category is for pure geography; if a question
is a geography-history hybrid, it should be counted against the
history quota.

<H2>Question Difficulty</H2>

<H3>Definitions</H3>
For the purposes of this section, <CITE>novice team</CITE>
means a team equal in strength to a typical bottom-bracket finisher
at ACF nationals, or a typical freshman team from an established
program. Writers are entitled to assume that this hypothetical
novice team is reasonably well-balanced between category
specialists. The hypothetical <CITE>median team</CITE> is exactly that; a
team that would finish at about the .500 mark in a past ACF
nationals; this would usually be any good (but not overpowering)
circuit team. A <CITE>knowable</CITE> question is one that, <EM>if read in its
entirety</EM>, should be known with certainty by at least one member of
the hypothetical team.  A <CITE>guessable</CITE> question is one where at
least one member of the hypothetical team will know a finite set of
possible right answers, and have a non-trivial chance of guessing
correctly.<P>

Some examples might help here:<P>

1. ... Name this battle of July 1863, the bloodiest battle
of the Civil War.<BR>
Answer: _Gettysburg_<P>

This is an knowable question for a novice team, as the giveaway
clue is common knowledge to most educated Americans.<P>

2. Name this novel about a three-year-old who refuses to
grow up, the most famous work of Gunther Grass.<BR>
Answer: The _Tin Drum_<P>

This is probably neither knowable nor guessable for a novice team,
as few new players will have heard of Gunther Grass.  However, it
is probably knowable by a median team.<P>

3. ... Name this Eugene O'Neill tragedy, whose main
characters are Harry Hope and Theodore Hickman.<BR>
Answer: The _Iceman Cometh_<P>

This is probably knowable by neither the novice nor the median
team, since the contents of Eugene O'Neill plays are a bit less
familiar to most of us than their titles.  However, it is guessable
by both, since almost everybody has at least heard of this work
(even if they have no idea what it is actually about).<P>

<H3>Percentages of Knowable and Guessable Questions</H3>
At least 60% of tossup giveaways should be knowable by the
novice team, and at least an additional 10% should be guessable.<P>

At least 80% of tossup giveaways should be knowable by the
median team, and at least an additional 10% should be guessable.<P>

It should be emphasized that, in the case of tossups, these
are minima, not maxima. Hard tossups should never be written
for the sake of writing hard tossups alone.<P>

<H3>Bonuses</H3>
Bonuses should be calibrated as follows: a novice team should
average about 5-10 points per bonus, which can be achieved if 15-20
of the bonus points belong to novice-guessable clues. Median teams
should average about 15 points per bonus, which can be achieved if
5-10 points are median-knowable and an additional 10-15 points are
median-guessable. These are very loose guidelines, of course, and
while it is not necessary that every individual bonus conform
exactly to this rule, the average should look something like this.<P>

<H2>Question Content</H2>

<H3>General Principles</H3>
ACF-format questions should first and foremost reward
knowledge. While questions that primarily reward other factors--
anticipation, buzzer speed, or luck-- might be acceptable in
another format, they should be deemphasized in ACF. This is not to say
that a question cannot try to reward both knowledge and
anticipation, but in these cases the knowledge-element should
predominate.<P>

Substantive knowledge is preferable to fluff knowledge or
trivia. Questions should try to favor players who actually
understand a topic over those who have merely memorized a list of
facts. For example, knowing the substance of Bertrand Russell's
ideas is far more important than knowing the year in which he won
the Nobel Prize, and a question on Bertrand Russell should reflect
this.<P>

ACF-format questions should be oriented towards the well-
informed layperson, not the specialist. For example, questions
about law should cover that material which a well-educated non-
lawyer should know, and which she has a reasonable opportunity to
learn without going to law school. Science questions may assume
familiarity with introductory-level college course material, but
more advanced topics should be included only to the extent that a
layperson could learn about them through a magazine like
"Scientific American." Questions that ask for technical jargon not
easily learnable by a layperson should be avoided, regardless of
the category.<P>

Note that this is not a general limitation on difficulty-- only on
certain types of difficulty. For example, a bonus part about an
obscure composer like Henryk Gorecki is acceptable, since some
classical music fans may know about him simply by virtue of being
classical music fans. By contrast, a more technical question about
counterpoint theory is less acceptable, even though it might be far
easier than the Gorecki question to a person who is studying
composition.<P>

Questions should be entertaining. Considering the audience
that you will be writing for, the easiest way to do this is to make
them informative-- try to write your questions in such a way that
they stick in people's minds, and make your facts memorable enough
that even if your audience can't get a particular question right,
they will learn and remember something new. Boring questions are
often boring simply because the author doesn't try to tell a good
story with his material.<P>

Questions should not ask for "essay answers." This is simply
too great a burden on the moderator.<P>

<H3>Tossup Structure</H3>

Tossups should almost never exceed eight single-screen lines
in length. (On most word processors, this means eight line of 12-
point courier type, on a page with standard one-inch margins).  If
at all possible, writers should aim for seven-line questions.
(Even shorter questions are also acceptable, but not at the expense
of other requirements outlined in this section).<P>

For purposes of this section, tossups are divided into three
parts: lead-in, development, and giveaway. The lead-in is the
introductory information for the question; although it does not
necessarily have to be a single sentence, it should not extend past
the middle of the question's third line.  The giveaway is the last
piece of substantive information in the question, it should begin
no earlier than the middle of the second-to-last line. The
development is everything in between.<P>

All lead-ins should contain information that is unique,
substantive, and reasonably identifiable by a player with
exceptional knowledge of the question's subject. The lead-in
should also be difficult enough that it will not be answered by a
player with only average knowledge of the subject.<P>

Lead-ins should not contain "list" information. Examples of
list-information include Nobel Prize years, atomic numbers, or
birth years.<P>

Where possible, lead-ins should contain a pronoun that
signals the type of information that the answer is seeking. If
considerations of style make a pronoun-flag impossible, the
question should allow for reasonable alternate answers to be
accepted if answered early.<P>

Lead-ins should avoid dry recitations of biographical facts,
especially where they give no reasonably identifiable information
about the answer. In particular, lead-ins that begin, "Born in X,
he was the son of a Y, and was educated at Z" should not be used.<P>

Lead-ins should not encourage random guessing, and should not
suggest one obvious answer to those with less-than-exceptional
knowledge. For example, "This Norwegian playwright" is a terrible
lead-in, since many players will (wisely) ring in at this point
with "Ibsen," since he may be the only Norwegian playwright that
they know.<P>

Lead-ins should not be written with the intention of
provoking incorrect buzzes. "His operas include _La Boheme_" is a
bad lead-in if the answer is Leoncavallo (who wrote the lesser-
known version); for other reasons, it is a bad-lead in even if the
answer is Puccini.<P>

To the greatest extent possible, the information contained in
the transition should be a logical continuation of the story told
in the lead-in. Transitions should not read like an abrupt non-
sequitur.<P>

Transitions should contain at least two distinct nuggets of
information, from which a player might reasonably be expected to
answer the question.<P>

Transitions should be strictly pyramidal: transitional facts
should be easier than the lead-in fact(s), and more difficult than
the giveaway fact.  Within the transition, facts should be arranged
in strict descending order of difficulty.<P>

Giveaway clues should be preceded by the words, "for ten
points, ..." (or FTP, to use packet-writing shorthand).<P>

Giveaway clues should be designed to make the question
answerable to as many players as possible. "FTP, name this author
of _Anna Karenina_" is a better giveaway clue than "FTP, name this
author of _Resurrection_."<P>

<H3>Bonus Structure</H3>
All bonuses should be designed so that, if graphed, the
scores of many teams playing the same question would take the form
of a bell-curve. Perfect scores on a particular bonus question
should be rare (though not impossible); scores of zero should be
about equally rare.<P>

All bonuses should have a maximum of thirty points available.<P>

All bonuses should award points in multiples of five.<P>

There should be a general consistency in the difficulty of bonuses within
the same packet.<P>

Single-part, all-or-nothing bonuses should not be written.<P>

Although bonuses would ideally test related pieces of
information, the parts should not be so closely related that a
multiple-part bonus effectively works out to an all-or-nothing.
(That is, that knowledge of one part is so strongly correlated with
knowledge of the other parts that any team playing it is likely to
get full points, or no points).<P>

No bonus should take longer than 45 seconds to complete.
(Remember, under ACF rules, teams are entitled to 5 seconds per
bonus part to prepare an answer).<P>

Bonus introductions should be as short and to-the-point as
possible.<P>

All bonus questions should clearly indicate the point values
assigned to each part.<P>

<H3>Proven Formats</H3>
The following bonus formats have worked well in past ACF
competition. Note that the fact that a bonus format is not listed
here does not necessarily mean that it shouldn't be used.
<UL>
<LI>Two parts, worth 15 each
<LI>Three parts, worth 10 each
<LI>Three parts, worth 5, 10, and 15
<LI>Four parts, 10-10-5-5
<LI>Six parts, 5 each, but only if the questions themselves
are so short that the 45 second limit can be reached. In other
words, it must be possible to read the entire question, and all of
the answers, in under fifteen seconds, since the other thirty
seconds is reserved for team consultation. Generally, this is
possible only where the clues are themselves single words (Example:
For five points each, given an island, name the capital. 1.
Madagascar...).  Essay questions ("Identify these artists, given a
brief description of their deaths") should not be used in six-part
bonus questions.
<LI>30-20-10
<LI>30-20-10, unrelated parts. (Each part has a different
answer, but the question ends as soon as one part is answered
correctly).
<LI>10-5. Three answers, ten points for identifying it on a
hard clue, if the team guesses incorrectly, it gets an easy clue
and a chance to guess again for five).
<LI>Variations of the 10-5: 15-10-5, 15-5, or 15-10.
<LI>List generation bonuses: eg., name six of the seven Holy
Roman Electors circa 1600 for five points each; name the first
three women in space for ten points each.
<LI>Yale ordering bonuses. A list of six items is given,
teams choose as many as they think they know and rank them in some
specified order; if all ranked items are correctly placed relative
to each other, the team gets five points for each item ranked, if
anything is out of order, they get nothing. Note: teams should be
given at least fifteen seconds on consultation time for questions
of this type.
<LI>"Matching" bonuses. This should only be done in questions
of at least six parts. Again, extra consultation time should be
awarded.
</UL>

<H3>Not-so-good Formats</H3>
The following bonus formats have not worked as well, and
should be avoided:
<UL>
<LI>Single-clue, single-answer bonus questions
<LI>Binary bonuses, where every answer is a yes-or-no or its
equivalent. Also ternary bonuses. However, questions that present
four or more options may be used, including those of the "X, Y,
both, or neither" format.
<LI>Bonuses that require calculations that cannot be performed
without pencil and paper
<LI>Ordering bonuses not scored according to the Yale system,
or a reasonable equivalent
</UL>

<H3>Discouraged Questions</H3>

The following is a list of question topics which, though
popular on the circuit as a whole, should not be included in your
packets for the 1998 ACF-format nationals.<P>

<STRONG>Trash</STRONG> questions. As a general rule of thumb, any question
that is appropriate for a trash tournament is inappropriate for an
ACF tournament, just as any appropriate ACF question will usually
be inappropriate for a trash tournament. (BTW, this is not a slam
against trash players or trash questions-- only that we think that
there is some virtue in treating trash as an entirely separate
format).  There is one extremely narrow exception to this rule:
serious jazz and serious film questions might have a place in both
formats, although this exception should not be extended to Kenny G
or the filmography of Pauly Shore.<P>
<STRONG>Straight-out-of-Benet's</STRONG> questions. Although <CITE>Benet's
</CITE> is
probably the outstanding question-writing source in print today,
its wide popularity has caused some problems. In particular,
questions should be written so that a person who actually has
outside knowledge of writer X will have an advantage over the
player who has merely memorized the Benet's entry for Writer X.  As
a result, every literature question should try to contain some
information that cannot be found in Benet's. (Of course, subject
to this rule, there is nothing wrong with continuing to use <CITE>Benet's</CITE>
 as a writing resource).<P>
     This same rule also applies to <CITE>An Incomplete Education</CITE>.<P>
<STRONG>Spelling</STRONG> questions.<P>
Questions that are entirely based on <STRONG>memorization</STRONG> of the
Nobel Prizes, or of the Periodic Table.<P>
<STRONG>Name-the-element</STRONG> questions of the form: "Discovered in
1878 by von Tronka and Kohlhaas, its alloys include Revulurium,
Boorsteinium, and Edwardsium. Its atomic mass is 467.55, and its
melting point is 683 degrees Celsius. FTP, name this element with
atomic number 115, whose chemical symbol is Hp." There is nothing
wrong with an interesting or substantive question whose answer
happens to be a chemical element, however.<P>

<H2>Question Security and Accuracy</H2>

All questions submitted for ACF-Format Nationals 1998 should
be original and secure, in the sense that they should not have been
submitted to any other tournament (even if they have been revised),
or practiced on by any person not a member of the team who
submitted it.<P>

Question-writers are responsible for backing up the facts in
their packets with reliable sources.  We don't expect you to
footnote your questions, but if we write back to you and ask for a
source on a particular fact, you should be able to give us one.<P>

Do not write questions from memory without double-checking
your facts with a reliable source. Note that not all popular
reference books are factually reliable.  In particular, be careful
of: <EM>The Book of Lists</EM> and all its sequels; anything else written by
the authors of the Book of Lists, anything which markets itself as
an imitation of the Book of Lists; An Incomplete Education (science
sections particularly), and Ann Landers columns.<P>
