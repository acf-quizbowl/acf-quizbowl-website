<H1>1998 ACF Nationals Announcement</H1></CENTER>



On behalf of the University of Chicago and the Maryland Academic

Quiz Team, I am pleased to make a preliminary announcement for the

1998 ACF-format national championship tournament, to be held April

25-26, 1998, on the campus of the University of Maryland at College

Park.  Although no successor organization to ACF has been legally

incorporated as of this writing, it is intended that this

tournament will carry on the history and the tradition of ACF

nationals.<P>



We hope that every team in the country with an interest in the ACF

format will be able to attend this event, and as a result, we are

offering possibly the lowest entrance fee for any national

championship tournament in recent years-- as little as $10 per

team, depending on discounts.<P>



The tournament field will be capped at forty-eight teams.  As this

is a significantly higher number of teams than attended 1997 ACF

nationals, it is unlikely that any team wishing to play will be

turned away.  In the event that the field does begin to fill up,

priority will be as follows: <STRONG>1)</STRONG> schools not already entered will

take priority over additional teams from schools that already have

at least one team in the tournament, and <STRONG>2)</STRONG> based on performance

at comparable invitational events in 1997-98.  If the field grows

large enough that such action would be necessary, an announcement

will be made in this space.  Until then, any team may reserve space

in the tournament simply by submitting a packet.<P>



As in past years, the round-robin portion of the tournament will be

written by the participating teams themselves.  In an effort to

ensure that these packets are of the highest quality, we have

assembled a large team of veteran editors to oversee this process,

and are offering considerable discounts to teams that submit

packets early.  In addition, a detailed list of packet requirements

and a question-writing memo will be sent along with this

announcement.<P>



In case anybody needs an extra incentive to turn in a packet by the

early deadline, we are offering an additional bonus to teams that

submit questions by December 21, 1997: 55 free sets of practice

questions, which will be sent back as soon as we get your

questions.  These packets are described in a message that is being

posted along with this announcement.<P>



As mentioned above, the provisional date for this tournament will

be Saturday, April 25, and Sunday, April 26, 1998.  As far as we

know, this does not conflict with any standardized testing dates,

parents' days, or holidays of any known religions.  In the event

that a serious external conflict arises, the backup weekend will be

March 28-29.  Otherwise, the April 25 date will be made permanent

by December 1, so we advise any teams that know of conflicts to

let us know as soon as possible.<P>



<PRE>

The price structure for this tournament is as follows:

Base fee..............................$55.00

Bring a working buzzer system ........-10.00

Bring an experienced game official.....-5.00

Packet in by 12/20/1997...............-30.00 + practice packets

Packet submitted 12/21/97-1/31/98.....-10.00

Packet in after 2/15/98...............+10.00 + $1.00/each day late

No packet submitted by 3/17/98........+70.00 (total penalty)



Minimum entrance fee, with discounts-- $10.00

Maximum, with penalties--  $125.00

</PRE>



No packets will be accepted after the final deadline of March 17,

1998, as it will be simply impossible to guarantee the quality of

any questions submitted after this date.  In addition, teams not

meeting this final deadline will not be guaranteed spots in the

tournament.<P>



We hope that as many teams as possible will take advantage of the

earliest deadline of December 20, 1997.  While we realize that this

might be an inconvenience for some programs, for whom the 1998 ACF

rosters are not yet determined, we will try to be flexible on the

game schedules, and if given notice, we will try to arrange bye

rounds so that a team could shift members from the A to B team

after the packet submission without compromising question security.<P>



To aid in this process, we ask that each packet includes the names

of players who contributed to it.<P>



Although the tournament is being held at Maryland, the organizer of

this event will be the University of Chicago team, which bears

ultimate responsibility for its content and conduct.  Accordingly,

all questions should be directed to <A HREF="mailto:jsheahan@midway.uchicago.edu">

John Sheahan</A>.<P>



Hope to see all of you in April,<P>
