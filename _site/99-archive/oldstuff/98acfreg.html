<H1>1998 ACF Regionals Announcement</H1></CENTER>



As with ACF Nationals, this will be a tournament run using the old ACF

format and rules, and intended to carry on the spirit and style of ACF

Regionals, but is not run by any incorporated organization.<P>



The tournament will be held on the Friday and Saturday, February 27-28.  If

there is a need, one or more of the multiple tournaments can possibly be

moved to another weekend.  Schools should inform me of such a need.<P>



The following are the host sites:<P>

These contacts are the individual tournament hosts; Direct to

<A HREF="mailto:mac47@cornell.edu">Matt Colvin</A> any

questions of a more general nature.<P>



Since John Sheahan gave such a clever and irresistable inducement to teams

submitting questions early for Nationals, I figured I would make a similar

offer of the Colvin opus for ACF Regionals.  This is a little unfair to

those teams who already traded questions with me (Iowa State, Chicago, MIT,

Virginia, CWRU, Berkeley, Oklahoma, and CalTech), but I hope they will not

have any objections.<P>



So, if you get your questions in by January 17th, you will get 50 packets

of tossups only and 5 packets of tossups and bonuses.  Thus, by submitting

questions early to ACF Regionals and ACF Nationals, you will not only help

guarantee the high quality of those tournaments, you will also make out

like a bandit.<P>



When writing your packet, you should follow the same style and distribution as for ACF Nationals, but adjust the difficulty accordingly, keeping in mind that the median team at most Regionals is not as strong as the median team at Nationals.  The Writing Guide is located <A HREF="writers.html">here</A>.



The fee structure:<P>



<PRE>

Base Fee:     $80 for first team

	      -10 for each additional team

Early ?'s     -30 (by January 17th) + free 55 packets by Matt Colvin.

	      -20 (by January 24th) but no free packets.

	      -10 (by January 31st)

	       -5 (by February 7th)

	Questions must be received by February 14th.

	After Feb. 14th: send them and grovel.  Maybe it'll be OK.

Buzzer system -10 (per working system)

Moderator:    -20 (must be arranged with host team; host team's discretion

		   whether to accept services and award discount)

</PRE>



Thus the minimum fee, with questions in, a buzzer, and a moderator, is $20,

plus you would get a ton of ACF practice questions.  The maximum fee is

still only $80.<P>



Send any questions you need to ask, or any packets you want to submit, to
