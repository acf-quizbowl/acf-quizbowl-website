<H1>1999 Midwest ACF Regionals Announcement</H1>
</CENTER>

The University of Chicago hereby announces the 1999 ACF Midwest Regionals,
to be held here in lovely Hyde Park Feb 26-7.<P>

Everything about this tournament (except the questions :) is likely to be
similar to last year's regionals, including the FREE GIORDANO'S PIZZA!!! For
those of you who have not had good Chicago-style stuffed-crust pizza, this
is not to be missed. (Yes, it will be stuffed-crust this year... sorry again
about that.)<P>

Format will depend on the number of teams attending, but expect either a
full RR followed by a playoff RR or a division RR followed by playoff RRs.<P>

Questions should follow the official ACF <A HREF="writers.html">distribution</A> and 
<A HREF="formatting.html">formatting</A>, and should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:dhamiltn@wam.umd.edu">Dave
Hamilton</A> not later than Jan 31. ONE PACKET PER
SCHOOL (presumably from your best team), even if you're sending multiple teams. 
See the web pages (or email me) for eligibility info if you need it.<P>

I am currently working to set up a hotel block; more info on that to
registered teams when I have it.<P>

<H3>Fees</H3>

<PRE>
	Base fee: $90
	-$10 each additional team after first from a school.
	-$15 pack into Dave by Jan 15th.
	-$05 per working buzzer system, reserved in advance
	-$10 per experienced moderator, reserved in advance
	(we may limit the numbers of these two (above) discounts.)
	-$50 if your school has never attended an ACF RCT before.
	-$50 if you travel more than 500 miles to get to the ACF
	     Midwest RCT (distance between your start point & the tourney
	     as listed by freetrip.com, not by your odometer.)
	min fee $40.

Remember, with this you also get FREE GIORDANO'S PIZZA for lunch on Saturday.
</PRE>

If money is going to be a serious issue in terms of your school sending its
initial team & your school is not a "circuit" school, please contact me & we
can probably work something out.<P>

To register: Send an email with "ACF RCT" in the subject line to
mikez@tiac.net with all the applicable info (# of teams, discounts, etc). Do
not use this subject for questions; rather send me an email with "ACF
Question" in the subject line.<P>

Thanks, and I hope to see you in February!<P>
