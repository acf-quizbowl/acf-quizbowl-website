</CENTER>

The 1999 ACF Northeast Regional Championship will take place on Saturday,
February 27, 1999 at MIT.  Join us for a day chock-full of things that Matt
Colvin thinks you should know!  Each school must submit one pack of
questions (written by only one team) to Dave Hamilton at Maryland
(<A HREF="mailto:dhamiltn@wam.umd.edu">dhamiltn@wam.umd.edu</A>) -- 
the deadline is 31 January.  Question guidelines are <A HREF="writers.html">here</A>.
More general packet guidelines are <A HREF="99acfreg.html">here</A>.<P>
Here's the fee schedule:<P>
<PRE>
        $70 base fee
        -10 second team
        -15 pack in to Dave by 15 January (one discount per school)
        -5 for a (completely working) buzzer system
        -10 for an experienced game official
        -25 for a new school to the circuit

        $45 minimum fee
</PRE>

We promise the rooms are much closer together this time :-).  We are going
to limit schools to 2 teams initially, until we figure out how much space
we have to spare.<P>

So come one, come all, and enjoy our famous Beaver hospitality!<P>
