<H3>Reading Tossups</H3>
Begin each question by saying "Tossup:" or "Tossup number x:".
This makes
sure no one will watch the other team buzz in and then say,
"that was a tossup?" Do not say "Tossup for a 30 point bonus:" -- everyone
already knows how much the bonus is worth.<P>
Read the tossup at a consistent and natural rate.
Do not pause dramatically before important pieces of information.
That is, do <STRONG>not</STRONG> say, <EM>....FTP, name this country whose
capital is at ... Tashkent.</EM><P>

<H3>Reading Bonuses</H3>
Read the bonus lead-in to the teams in its entirety. Even if it seems
trivial or boring, it may contain important information (such as how the
bonus is to be scored). If the bonus says "name these things, 10-5 each,"
that means that each answer has two clues that are to be given separately,
and the team may guess after each one.<P>

Do not announce the answer for each bonus part until you have finished the
entire bonus (unless the question contains instructions to read each answer
before going on to the next). This ensures that teams must use knowledge,
not process-of-elimination strategy, to answer each part.<P>

Clearly announce how many points the team earned at the end of the bonus.
Also go over the missed answers at the end of the bonus. You need not
reread each bonus part:<P>

If the bonus part said:<P>
2. In order to disprove the claim that the universe exists only in our
head, what other man stubbed his foot on a rock and said, "I refute it thus?"<BR>
Answer:  Samuel _Johnson_<P>

You can give the answer by saying:<BR>
"The guy who stubbed his foot was Samuel Johnson".<P>

<H3>Ruling Tossup Answers Incorrect</H3>
Be unequivocal in ruling an answer wrong. Do not say, "Close" or "you didn't
get it out in time." These statements amount to an extra (and thus unfair)
clue for the other team. Saying "Minus five" is always foolproof.<P>

<H3>Accepting Blitzes</H3>
If a player chooses to <CITE>blitz</CITE> (give a string of possible answers), you should
accept the blitz if you cannot find anything wrong with it. If you know
that one of the pieces of information given was incorrect (e.g.
"The Battle of Issus at which Alexander the Great defeated Xerxes."), then
you may rule the answer wrong and award a -5 WITHOUT specifying to the
other team what part of the blitz was incorrect. If you do not know enough
about the answers given to determine if a blitz was correct or incorrect,
you should accept the blitz and award points if the correct answer was given.<P>

What is an improper blitz? If the player has given several answers that are
all within a single category according to the question, then you can rule
the player incorrect if his first answer was not the correct one. For
instance, if a question starts, <EM>This sculptor of David...</EM>, and a player
buzzes and blitzes with "Donatello, Michelangelo, Bernini, and Verrochio,"
and the answer was Michelangelo, then you should rule the player incorrect
because all his answers fit the category <EM>sculptors of David</EM> and he
should have waited for more information to narrow it down. If, however, the
answer was Michelangelo, and the player said, "Michelangelo Buonarotti who
was employed by Julius II to paint the Sistine Ceiling," then you should
accept the blitz because Michelangelo, Julius, and the ceiling are in three
different categories (<EM>artist, patron, work</EM>).<P>

Note that the blitz, "Alexander the Great defeated Darius III at the
Battle of Issus" is a perfectly legitimate blitz for Darius III because
Alexander is the winning general while Darius is the losing general.
They are thus in different categories.<P>

If you are unsure about whether to accept a blitz, accept it and the
tournament director can deal with any protest concerning it later.<P>

<H3>Calling Time</H3>
Try to be consistent in calling time. You may look at your own watch to
keep yourself consistent if you want. Teams get 5 seconds on all normal
questions, whether tossups or bonuses (more on lists and calculations).
That's 5 seconds after they ring in, and they can hem and haw all they want
until those 5 seconds are up. And they need only start their answer before
the end of the 5 seconds in order to have it accepted. E.g.:<P>
<PRE>
Reader: (buzz)---1---2---3---4---5 (reader is counting time)
Player: (buzz)------------------The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat...
</PRE><P>

However, the official time limit is from the point of the buzz to when you
call "time". If you were counting "1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi..." in your
head, then that is the official time. Teams cannot protest that your 5
seconds were not a real 5 seconds. Therefore, since teams do not have
recourse if you miscount, try to be consistent and as close to 5 seconds as
possible.  If teams are complaining about your timekeeping, you should
probably use a watch to pace yourself.<P>

In order to call time on a player, you must say "Time" before he begins to
say anything. That is, you cannot let him say the answer while you sit there
and then say, "I'm sorry, you didn't get it out in time." You have to say
"Time" before he begins his answer. It is up to you, the reader, to
determine whether you said "Time" before the player started his answer
(it can be very close sometimes).<P>

<H3>Prompting for an Answer</H3>
On bonuses, you may prompt for an answer after 5 seconds. Say, "Captain?" or,
"Answer please" or, "Answer?". Allow the captain to designate someone quickly.<P>

Never prompt for an answer on a tossup. Simply call time after 5 seconds.<P>

<H3>The (Non) Recognition Rule</H3>
Here, for all time, is the official ACF Recognition Rule: If your light is
on, you're recognized.<P>

If a player has buzzed, the very fact that he has buzzed gives him the right
to answer the question.  You, the reader, do not confer that right on him by
recognizing him.<P>

By buzzing in, a player has also taken away everyone else's right to answer
the question.  If a player on the same team then gives an answer, you are to
award a minus 5 to that team, and finish the question for the other team.
E.g.:<P>

<PRE>
Reader:  "...Edict of Nantes.  FTP, name this second wife --"
[player A buzzes]
Player B (on same team): "Maria Theresa."
Reader:  "Minus five. FTP, name this second wife of Louis XIV."
[player 3 on other team buzzes]
Player 3: "The Marquise de Maintenon."
Reader: "Correct."
</PRE>

You may indicate that Player 3 had not buzzed in, but in so doing, do not
give any indication whether his answer was correct or incorrect.<P>

But if a player who has not buzzed in gives an answer when the OTHER team
has buzzed in, you should ignore him and let the correct player give an
answer. You may let him know that he has in fact buzzed in. E.g.:<P>

<PRE>Reader:  "...Edict of Nantes.  FTP, name this second wife of Louis XIV."
[player A buzzes]
Player 2 (on other team): "Maria Theresa."
Reader: [pointing to player A] "You have buzzed in."
Player A:  "The Marquise de Maintenon."
Reader: "Correct."
</PRE>

<H3>The Packet</H3>
Do not re-order the packet in any way or kill questions without explicit
instructions to do so from the Tournament Director. In the case of ACF
Regionals, the Tournament Director should use the questions as provided
without modification to ensure uniformity at all Regionals.<P>

<H3>Protests</H3>
Teams may protest at any pause in the game (not just the half or end). Tell
the team that its protest has been noted and will be dealt with if it makes
a difference in the outcome of the game. Submit protests at the end of the
game to the Tournament Director.<P>

You should accept any protest a team wishes to lodge, even if it concerns a
matter usually covered by "moderator discretion." The admissibility of the
protest is the concern not of the reader, but of the tournament director.
