<p><strong>ACF Fall</strong> is the premier easy tournament in college quizbowl. Designed as an introduction to college quizbowl for novices and players with limited high school quizbowl experience, over 200 teams compete on ACF Fall each year, making it the most widely-played set in the college calendar.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>We hope that ACF Fall can be held in person. However, we acknowledge that many schools are uncertain about the possibility of allowing large events due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it is possible that some mirrors of ACF Fall will be held online, and we will work to create the most authentic and engaging quizbowl experience possible under these circumstances. We will continue to post updates as we learn more.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>This tournament will follow <a href="/gameplay-rules">ACF’s official gameplay rules</a>. Rules specifically pertaining to online tournaments are in blue.</p>

<!--## Registration
To register for 2021 ACF Fall, fill out the central [2021 ACF Fall registration form](https://forms.gle/kG9b7Rj4zo49zKtf8) with all relevant information.

If possible, teams should register for the site that is geographically closest to them and/or is in the region they would normally attend.

## Field
The field (list of registered teams) for each site can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P4tdvLOAb_yQhPQqkl6PMsTyxn-Y1L2Ae25EzY6H3EU/edit).-->

<h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Team entry fee or discount</th>
      <th> </th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Base fee per team</td>
      <td>$120</td>

      <td>New to quizbowl discount</td>
      <td>−$80</td>

      <td>−$25 per staffer with functional laptop. Staffers must register with ACF in advance.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The minimum fee is $0 per team.</p>

<p>The “new to quizbowl” discount is for schools that did not send a team to any regular collegiate academic tournament (not counting exclusively novice tournaments) since September 2021, and which have no players who competed in non-novice collegiate tournaments during that same period.</p>

<p>Host sites will bill teams as soon as possible after the teams register. Teams should pay their host sites by whatever method is convenient for the hosts, who will in turn pay ACF by check, cash, or PayPal.</p>

<p>See below for packet submission discounts.</p>

<h2 id="packet-submission">Packet submission</h2>
<p>Like the 2021 edition of ACF Fall, no teams are required to submit questions in order to play the tournament. However, ACF still needs high-quality half-packet submissions from teams to complete the set.</p>

<p><strong>If a team wishes to outsource part of its packet to a player not expected to play on that team (e.g., a student who has graduated), it must first receive approval from the head editors. Non-playing students are welcome and encouraged to help their newer club members write, especially for Fall, but it’s useful to know the contributors for both credit and logistical reasons.</strong></p>

<p>Below is the submission schedule for ACF Fall. All deadlines are at 11:59 p.m. PT. The maximum packet discounts have increased since last year; furthermore, all submitting teams are eligible for an additional −$20 quality discount if their questions are particularly polished and usable, up to a maximum discount of −$60. Teams may submit a maximum of one half-packet.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you would like to submit a half-packet, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/XwNLS2FaY6BtTzM59">this form</a>. ACF will respond with a half-packet template specifying which categories you are assigned to write.</p>

<p>Each submission consists of 12 tossups and 12 bonuses. Before writing, please review <a href="/packet-submission-guidelines">ACF’s packet submission guidelines</a> and stick to the format provided. Answers should generally emphasize playability over creativity – aim for creative and interesting clues with straightforward answerlines. These <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mokTuDeyDDSb4J1yQG6BWeGsee4x-RFsqf-lmvfBXjc/edit">5 model tossups</a> reflect the difficulty and style to aim for. When finished, submit your half-packet by emailing it to <a href="mailto:fall@acf-quizbowl.com">fall@acf-quizbowl.com</a>.</p>

<p>Your assigned half-packet may ask you to write questions from specific categories within the distribution. For instance, instead of being assigned an “American Literature” tossup, you might be asked to write a question on a 20th-century American poem, or an Economics bonus instead of “Social Science/Philosophy.” This should reduce redundancy in submissions and maximize the number of submitted questions we can use, without being too constraining. The submission form offers space to indicate your writing interests in each category, which we will do our best to accommodate.</p>

<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>ACF Fall uses the <a href="/distribution">standard ACF distribution</a>.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
<p>To make this tournament more accessible to new teams and players, ACF is enforcing eligibility guidelines for ACF Fall. Players are not eligible to compete at 2022 ACF Fall if, <em>at any point</em>, they met any of the following exclusion criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scored more than 50 PPG in the prelims of a college mirror of ACF Fall</li>
  <li>Were the top scorer (highest overall PPG) on a team that finished in the top 15% of the field, rounded up, at ACF Fall</li>
  <li>Scored more than 40 PP20TUH in the prelims of HSNCT or 60 PPG in the prelims of PACE NSC</li>
  <li>Were the top scorer (highest overall PPG) on a team that finished in the top 30 at HSNCT or top 10 at PACE NSC</li>
  <li>Finished in the top 12 in IPNCT</li>
  <li>Scored more than 20 PPG in the prelims of ACF Nationals</li>
</ul>

<p>The eligibility restrictions do not apply to high-school-only mirrors.</p>

<p><strong>Players are responsible for determining their own eligibility. If you have questions, email <a href="mailto:eligibility@acf-quizbowl.com">eligibility@acf-quizbowl.com</a>. Failure to abide by these eligibility guidelines may result in disqualification from ACF Fall and/or future ACF tournaments.</strong></p>
