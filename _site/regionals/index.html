<h2 id="editors">Editors</h2>
<p>JinAh Kim, alumna of the University of Pennsylvania, will be head editor. The editors will be Dennis Loo, Geoffrey Chen, Jordan Brownstein, Neilesh Vinjamuri, Nick Jensen, Nitin Rao, Taylor Harvey, and Wonyoung Jang, with Billy Busse and Ophir Lifshitz providing oversight for science and music, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="packet-submission">Packet submission</h2>
<p>Any team with at least two people on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2018, is required to submit a half-packet, unless it is a high school team attending a high-school-only mirror. If you are unsure whether your team is required to submit a half-packet, please email us at <a href="mailto:regionals@acf-quizbowl.com">regionals@acf-quizbowl.com</a>.</p>

<p><em>For these purposes, all ACF tournaments, NAQT SCT (Division I or Division II), NAQT ICT, and typical college-level academic invitationals count as regular collegiate academic tournaments. Pop culture or “hybrid” tournaments, HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT’s Collegiate Novice series sets do not.</em></p>

<p>The submission schedule is as follows (your submission must be sent to <a href="mailto:regionals@acf-quizbowl.com">regionals@acf-quizbowl.com</a> by 11:59 PM PT):</p>
<ul>
  <li>November 10, 2019: -$50</li>
  <li>November 24, 2019: -$25</li>
  <li>December 8, 2019: -$0</li>
  <li>December 22, 2019: +$25</li>
  <li>December 29, 2019: +$50</li>
</ul>

<p>After December 29, 2019, teams will be required to pay an additional $10 per day their packet is late. <strong>Teams that have not submitted a packet by January 12, 2020, will be dropped from the tournament.</strong></p>

<p>The submission discounts and penalties – but not the schedule – will likely differ for teams attending sites outside of the United States, and will be determined by ACF and the host sites by October 27.</p>

<p>If your team is obligated to submit a half-packet or wishes to do so, please email <a href="mailto:regionals@acf-quizbowl.com">regionals@acf-quizbowl.com</a> to request a 12/12 distribution. Please submit your half-packet to to the same email. The actual email with the attached half-packet should have a subject line reading: “HALF PACKET: <Tournament Name=""> <Year> – <School Name=""> <Team Name="" or="" Letter="">" (for example, "HALF PACKET: ACF Regionals 2020 - Alaska A"). In order to meet a deadline, you must submit your half-packet before 11:59pm Pacific Time on that date. Half-packets should be submitted in Microsoft Word .doc or .docx format. Please do not submit packets as pdfs. **If a team wishes to outsource part of its packet to a player not expected to play on that team (e.g. a student who has graduated), it must first receive approval from the head editor.**</Team></School></Year></Tournament></p>

<h2 id="apply-to-host">Apply to host</h2>
<p>If you are interested in hosting a mirror of ACF Regionals, please contact ACF’s Mirror Coordinator, Alex Damisch, at <a href="mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com">hosting@acf-quizbowl.com</a>, CC’ing <a href="mailto:regionals@acf-quizbowl.com">regionals@acf-quizbowl.com</a>. Hosts will be expected to abide by <a href="/hosting-guidelines">ACF’s Hosting Guidelines</a>, which have been extensively revised for 2019–2020. Applications to host ACF Regionals will close on October 13, 2019; sites will be announced by October 24, 2019.</p>

<p>ACF intends to mirror ACF Regionals in <a href="https://acf-quizbowl.com/hosting-guidelines/#regions-according-to-acf">the following regions</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Northeast</li>
  <li>Upper Mid-Atlantic</li>
  <li>Lower Mid-Atlantic</li>
  <li>Southeast</li>
  <li>Florida</li>
  <li>Great Lakes</li>
  <li>Midwest</li>
  <li>North</li>
  <li>South Central</li>
  <li>Mountain West</li>
  <li>California</li>
  <li>Northwest</li>
  <li>Eastern Canada</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
<p>Registration will open once sites have been announced. If you would like to receive your half-packet distribution for packet submission in advance, please email <a href="mailto:regionals@acf-quizbowl.com">regionals@acf-quizbowl.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>
<p>Additional details can be found on <a href="https://acf-quizbowl.com/hosting-guidelines/#finances">the ACF website</a>. Fees and discounts for this tournament are structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Base fee: $150 ($75 for shorthanded teams of 1 or 2 players)</li>
  <li>Buzzer: -$10/functional system</li>
  <li>Staffers: -$15/staffer with laptop</li>
  <li>Travel discount: -$10 per 200 miles traveled one-way</li>
  <li>Packet submission discounts: As noted above</li>
  <li>New quizbowl team: -$100</li>
</ul>

<p>The “New quizbowl team” discount is intended for schools that did not send a team to any regular collegiate academic tournament (exclusively Novice tournaments do not count) since September 2018, and have no one on the team(s) claiming this discount who played those tournaments for another school.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>This tournament is intended to be close in difficulty to ACF Regionals 2019, and easier than ACF Regionals 2018. While writing submissions, please keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least 50% of tossup answerlines should be things that can be tossed up at ACF Fall or below. This does not mean “answerlines for which a theoretical Fall-level giveaway exists,” but rather answerlines that actually could have a Fall-level (or easier!) tossup written on them.</li>
  <li>The remaining tossup answerlines should be predominantly things that could be uncontroversially tossed up at regular difficulty. While you should feel free to submit tossups with unconventional answerlines that are still accessible (e.g. the trend of writing harder tossups on elements of core-canon works) these should make up no more than one or two of your overall submission.</li>
  <li>As Will put it last year, “Easy parts for bonuses should be genuinely easy,” gettable by around 90% of teams. However, try and avoid “curved yellow fruit” style bonuses that a) don’t reward knowledge and b) can actually obfuscate an answer.</li>
  <li>Tossups this year will be hard-capped at seven lines, 10-point Times New Roman with one-inch margins. Please do not submit tossups that run into the ninth line or are shorter than five full lines. For bonuses, please do not submit any bonus parts that are over three lines, and aim for 1-2 lines per part.
Submissions that flagrantly disregard the length or difficulty guidelines will be sent back to teams and will be considered unsubmitted for the purposes of packet discounts. If you would like to request an extension for your deadline, please submit your request and explanation to <a href="mailto:regionals@acf-quizbowl.com">regionals@acf-quizbowl.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
