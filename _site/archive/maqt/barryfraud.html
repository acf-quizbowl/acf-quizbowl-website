<H2>WARNING:  THIS IS NOT A JOKE</H2>

<H3>I repeat, This is not a joke.</H3>

On Sunday, November 3, 1996, the Maryland Academic Quiz Team will no
longer be content hosting other school's trash tournaments. Instead, we
will be hosting our own, the first annual Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. Fraud
Bowl. The tournament will be run and organized by the Tournament
Directorate, composed of Tournament Director-at Arms, Jesse Molesworth,
Tournament Director-de-Camp, David Vacca, and Lord High Tournament
Director, David Goodman. Teams need not be affiliated with any particular
college, university, Political Action Committee, or religious cult to
enter.<P>

Rounds will consist of 20 untimed tossups, although participants will not
be prevented from bringing stopwatches.  All bonuses will be worth an
integer value no less than 20 points. Values for individual bonus parts
must have integral values. A bonus part worth 7 points is acceptable. A
bonus part worth 7 pi is not.<P>

The tournament will follow a round-robin format.  If the top two teams
have even records or are within one game of each other, a deciding match
will be held.  Otherwise, there will be match featuring the Tournament
Champions vs. The Tournament All-Stars, played on the Tournament
Directorate packet.<P>

<H3>The costs</H3>

<PRE>  $65 per team.
  $15 for a copy of the tournament packets</PRE><P>

<H3>Discounts</H3>

<PRE>  -$5 for a each working buzzer.
  -$15 for packets submitted by midnight, Sunday, October 20.
  -$15 for teams already attending the <A HREF=http://www.glue.umd.edu/~maqt/maqt/terrapin.html>Terrapin Invitational Tournament</A>.</PRE><P>

(Note: Teams need not have the same personnel, but must have the same
University Affiliation to qualify. Contact the tournament director with
any questions at <A HREF="mailto:dlgood@wam.umd.edu">
dlgood@wam.umd.edu</A>, or at (301) 314-4852.)<P>

The registration deadline is midnight, Thursday, October 24.
Packets are due midnight, Tuesday, October 29.<P>

Teams will not be permitted to play without submitting packets. Submissions
will be accepted by email in plain text format. Packets may be snail-mailed
by disk to the following address:<P>

<PRE>David L. Goodman
1107A Harford Hall
College Park, MD  20742</PRE><P>

In such a case, questions should be submitted in either Microsoft Word
(Version 5.0 or higher), Word Perfect (Version 5.0 or higher) or in
text-only format.<P>

Teams are invited to create all manner of creative and humorous names,
hopefully in some way related to Hizzoner, the Mayor-for-Life and/or his
exploits, though this will not be required.<P>

The tournament director reserves the right to reject and return for
revision any packets which do not satisfy the guidelines, or are
incomplete. The tournament director also reserves the right to send back
for revision, any team names which are incomplete, or are lame and
tasteless. This includes all names modeled upon the film "Three Men and a
Baby", though a "grandfather" clause extends to the original "Three Boys
and a Goy", should they choose to attend.<P>

<H3>Question Guidelines</H3>

The tournament director requests packets consisting of at least 25 tossups
and 25 boni, distributed as noted among the following categories.<P>

</TABLE><P>

TV/Films, Music, Science, Sci-Fi, and Technology, and Lit questions should focus on
things which are generally neat and cool rather than profoundly deep and
intellectually stimulating. (i.e. Tupperware or the spork home page as
opposed to Cyclotrons and Bubble Chambers) <EM>Editor's amendment: Anyone
writing about Star Trek as opposed to real science fiction will be
exposed and mocked by the field at large</EM>.<P>

Food questions should be about food and/or beverages. The TD would prefer
questions about foods he likes, but this will not be enforced as a rule.
(Spam is not considered a food: it is Technology). Questions may focus on
methods of preparation, chefs, cooking shows, odd ingredients, etc.<P>

Any hints of academia will be quashed, even in Government
Corruption/Inefficiency category (We couldn't hold a tournament in honor
of Mayor Barry without it).  Government Corruption can be extended to
include any form of government scandal, bureaucratic inefficiency, or
anything which paints the U.S. Government, D.C. Government, or any
governmental agency of any government in a less than positive light
without revealing classified information.<P>

Goofy Current Events include <EM>News of the Weird</EM> type items, Tabloid "news",
and other current event type items, be they in the world of sports, music,
TV, or Oklahoma trailer parks. However, the Mandatory Goofy Current Event
Question must focus on something which happened after November 3, 1995.<P>

Any event occurring before November 3, 1991 qualifies as an Old Current
Event. The Tournament Directorate prefers "Goofy Old Current Events".<P>

Useless Trivia/Miscellaneous encompasses any form of "trashy" knowledge
which does not easily fit into the other nine categories.  Alternatively,
useless trivia is what we call the other five questions which exceed the
minimum required number of questions for each of the other nine
categories.  Ideally all 20 should be construed as useless trivia of one
form or another. Miscellaneous does include Physical Challenge questions.
However, these questions must not discriminate unduly against differently
abled participants or budget conscious tournament directors.<P>
