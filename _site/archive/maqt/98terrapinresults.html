Congratulations to Sarah, Rob, Andrew, and Mike of Chicago A for
winning this year's Terrapin.  They emerged through the challenging
18-team field undefeated.  Congratulations also to South Carolina for
finishing second, including an undefeated run in the preliminary bracket.
Chicago A defeated South Carolina 275-95 in the final, after already
having a 1-0 lead by virtue of their playoff win the previous round.<P>

        *The Pitt Mafia was composed of Dwight Kidder, Mike McElroy from
Carnegie-Mellon, and a player from Pitt (sorry I do not know your name).<P>
        **Georgia State left at lunch time, after the prelims, so Maryland
fielded a second house team to take their place.<P>

        All ties were broken by head-to-head.  The top four teams in each
prelim bracket made the top playoff bracket, where they squared off
against the opposite four teams.  The rest were placed in a consolation
bracket, where teams played 4 out of 5 teams from the opposite bracket (a
system done similarly to AFC-NFC regular season interconference schedules,
if anyone understands what I'm talking about).<P>
