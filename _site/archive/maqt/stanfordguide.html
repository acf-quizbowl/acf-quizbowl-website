<H2>Introduction</H2>
At invitational tournaments, participants traditionally complain about poor
question quality and the need for question improvement and consistency.  
Complaints cite misleading, wordy, obscure, grammatically faulty, and
factually incorrect questions.  Poor question quality is a persistent
problem at invitational tournaments partly because of the lack of
guidance for  question writers.  This guide includes instructions for
question formats and packet composition.  In addition, some sample questions
are attached.  Whether you are a novice or experienced question writer, we
hope this guide provides useful information and reasonable question
expectations.<P>

Though editors will attempt to remove all duplicate and problem questions,
they cannot verify the accuracy of every questions submitted, nor rewrite
entire packets.  Question writers are responsible for the accuracy and
quality of their questions, and team captains should verify that all
questions are carefully edited and conform to packet guidelines.<P>

<H2>Mechanics</H2>

<H3>Question Quality and Accuracy</H3>

We recommend that teams read their questions aloud in a simulated
regulation (i.e. timed) match and that all information be verified in reputable
reference sources.  For example, books by Fred L. Worth
(e.g. <CITE>SuperTrivia</CITE>) and
Wallechinsky/Wallace (e.g. <CITE>The Book of Lists</CITE>,
<CITE>The People's Almanac</CITE>) are
notoriously error-filled and should not be used without verification.
Writers should not use copyrighted questions or questions previously used
in any competition.  Questions do not need to be footnoted, though you may
do so.<P>

<H3>Question Security</H3>

If your school is sending more than one team, it is critical that each
team write its packet blind of the other teams, as they may hear each
other's packets during the competition.  Separate disks for each team may
be mailed should no neutral person be available to place all the
teams' questions on one disk.<P>

<H2>Packet Specifications</H2>

<H3>Guidelines</H3>

Each packet should have at least 32 toss-up and 30 bonus questions.
Toss-ups are all worth 10 points apiece and bonuses are worth 20-30 points
each. Written for timed play, the packet should provide enough material for
14 minutes of play.  If a quick moderator can read only 20 or so toss-ups
with bonuses in 14 minutes, the questions are too long.<P>

Packets should be reasonably uniform in difficulty.<P>

Every packet should be balanced across the various topic areas.  These
goals are approximations, but try to keep the distribution balanced since
there will be many different users of the packet.<P>

<H3>Question Distribution</H3>

The target number of questions are as follows:<P>

[<STRONG>Ed.</STRONG>: These numbers in the above chart can vary slightly, but be very
careful to maintain a balance in categories!]

<H3>Topic Areas</H3>

<H4>Science</H4>

Introductory college courses, perusal of periodicals such as Science News,
Scientific American, Discover, or the Science section of The New York
Times should provide adequate background for science toss-ups and most
boni. Science includes, but is not limited to, biology, chemistry, astronomy,
physics, mathematics, and earth science.  Questions may come from the
history of science, but should also reflect important recent developments
or fundamental principles of relevance to contemporary science and
society.<P>

<H4>Literature</H4>

Literature questions can span the gamut within the history of literature,
and span the continents, though American and British literature is usually
emphasized.  Questions can cover authors, works, and content.  Bonus
questions should more often cover the contents of works rather than the
mere identification of authors and works since the former requires more
detailed knowledge.  Norton Anthologies and Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia
should provide an adequate background for most questions.<P>

<H4>History</H4>

American and European history tend to be more strongly represented than
the history of the other continents.  Half the questions should cover
pre-1945 events and half the post-1945 era.<P>

<H4>Current Events</H4>

To some it seems that this category is the most represented category.
However, it is important to separate a question which is in its essence a
science or history question, and has a current events lead-in to make it
interesting and topical, from a question which is truly about the recent
news.  For example, a question about Alger Hiss is essentially a history
question, even if the announcement by a Russian general that Hiss was not a
Soviet spy is a current event.<P>

<H4>General Knowledge</H4>

This category sweeps up the questions which are not subsumed in any other.
Word origins, spelling, calculation, and other miscellaneous information
fall under this category.<P>

<H4>Geography</H4>

Emphasizes North American, European, and African geography.<P>

<H4>Popular Culture</H4>

This includes television, film, popular music and other cultural icons.<P>

<H4>Sports</H4>

Sports includes the sports of and athletes in football, basketball,
baseball, soccer, and tennis, the Olympics, as well as a variety of
lesser-known sports.<P>

<H4>Fine Arts</H4>

Includes classical music, dance, theater, visual arts, and architecture.<P>

<H4>Religion/Mythology/Classics</H4>

This includes the Bible, world religions, Greek, Roman, and Norse
Mythology, and the classics of ancient literature.<P>

<H4>Social Sciences</H4>

This includes primarily psychology, law, sociology, and economics.<P>


<H2>Question Writing</H2>

<H3>General (Toss-Ups AND Boni)</H3>

<H4>Length</H4>

The question itself should be no more than 2 or 3 sentences, maximum.  All
difficult words should have a pronunciation guide following them, with the
stressed syllables in capital letters.  For example, Mogadishu would be
listed as Mogadishu (mo-go-DEE-shoo).<P>

<H4>Say How Much <EM>Every</EM> Question Is Worth</H4>

Just before the final key request, the phrase "for xx points" should appear.
This is especially important in toss-up questions to help identify the
targeted answer.

<H4>Format for the Answer</H4>

The answer appears below the question, following the word ANSWER:<P>

Answers are customarily written with the minimum information needed to
answer the question underlined:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A person's name would only have the last name underlined unless it
     were ambiguous.
<LI>Alternate answers should also be indicated.
<LI>Always include enough information to judge the acceptability of
     alternate or overly-complete answers.
<LI>If the answer is a foreign phrase, a contestant might give the
     response in the foreign language.  This can cause considerable
     problems when moderating if this alternate foreign-language answer is not
     specified.  We recommend that foreign language answers be included
     when appropriate to avoid problems.
</UL>

</PRE>

<H3>Toss-Up Questions</H3>

<H4>Spelling Tossups</H4>

If you choose to write spelling tossups, phrase the question as directly as
possible to avoid tricking contestants into mis-answering the question.
Always include a pronunciation guide for the word to be spelled and
separate letters in the answer by dashes to assist moderators in judging
responses.  For example:<P>

<EM>If pre-game nerves have made you unable to spell correctly, then
you're exhibiting "inappetence" (IN-AP-PE-TENTS). For ten points,
spell "inappetence."</EM><BR>
ANSWER: I-N-A-P-P-E-T-E-N-C-E<P>

<H4>Difficulty</H4>

90% of toss-up questions should be answerable by one of the eight players
if read in their entirety.  This is not the same as having 90% of the
toss-ups answered correctly in a match situation.<P>

Two aggressive teams should interrupt at least 80% of toss-ups.<P>

<H4>Length</H4>

Be terse. No toss-up question should be longer than two sentences (three
if they are short).<P>

<H4>How to Order the Clues</H4>

Order clues from most obscure to least obscure.  Two bad examples with the
answer of Otto von Bismarck follow:<P>

<EM>Known as the "Iron Chancellor," he received a famous telegram on
September 17, 1862 from War Minister Von Roon recalling him to Berlin
to take control the government. For ten points, name this statesman,
who ruled Prussia from 1862 to 1890.</EM><P>

In a real match, this question will likely be over in 5 words.  It could
be rewritten as:<P>

<EM>He received a famous telegram on September 17, 1862 from War Minister
Von Roon recalling him to Berlin to take control of the government.
For ten points, name this politician who ruled Prussia from 1862
to 1890, earning the nickname the "Iron Chancellor."</EM><P>

Another example of a poorly written question:<P>

<EM>The capital of North Dakota and the 19th century Duke of Lauenberg
who epitomized the Junker class share, FTP, what name?</EM><P>

This could be rewritten as:<P>

<EM>The 19th century Duke of Lauenberg who epitomized the Junker class
and the capital of North Dakota share, FTP, what name?</EM><P>

<H4>No Misleading Questions</H4>

Avoid misleading questions which penalize knowledge and speed.  These
questions are supremely evil in competition and are to be avoided.  Since
each tossup potentially means a swing in the game score of 85 points, it
is crucial that toss-ups be written clearly and fairly.  Neither of the
following is an acceptable question:<P>

<EM>A German Chancellor, A U.S. state capital, an archipelago northeast
of New Guinea, the sea enclosed by the archipelago, and the largest
city in Equitorial Guinea. FTP, which is not named "Bismarck?"</EM><P>

<EM>He served as German Chancellor from 1871 to 1890 and was known for
his policy of "blood and iron." FTP, spell his last name.</EM><P>

<H4>Watch Pronouns and Antecedents</H4>

Pronouns almost always must refer to the answer.  Use pronouns carefully so
as not to mislead the players.  Poor antecedent usage is most often the
culprit in poorly-written questions.  This example is poorly constructed:<P>

<EM>Vowing that he would never go to Canossa, the Chancellor of Germany
announced a cultural struggle against Roman Catholicism in the 1870's.
For ten points, what three-syllable German noun named this anti-Catholic
campaign?</EM><BR>
ANSWER: _KULTURKAMPF_<P>

This question tricks a player into answering Bismarck early.  It could be
rewritten as:<P>

<EM>German Chancellor Bismarck, vowing never to go to Canossa, announced
a cultural struggle against Roman Catholicism in the 1870's known,
for ten points, by what three-syllable German noun?</EM><P>

<H4>Minimize Ambiguous Introductions</H4>

Some questions have several possible answers after a few words have been
read.<P>

<EM>Facing legal difficulties because of alleged financial chicanery,
he resigned as Vice-President of the United States...</EM><P>

Agnew is not the only answer.  Calhoun had similar, if less widely known,
difficulties in his time.  Some players will interrupt the question at
this point.  Players who are waiting to differentiate between Agnew and
Calhoun will be at a disadvantage to other players who are thinking of
only Agnew.  Or, a player who is aware of Calhoun may bet the odds and
incorrectly answer Agnew.  Either way, this question might trap a better
player, penalizing knowledge.<P>

One might choose to add additional information at the start of the
question to minimize this ambiguity and precisely target the desired
answer as soon as possible, as in:<P>

<EM>This former governor, facing legal difficulties because of
alleged financial chicanery...</EM><P>

There is nothing wrong with questions in which the answer is not the
immediately obvious one.  Further, there is nothing wrong with more
general introductions (<EM>This U.S. President...</EM>).  However, you should
strive to minimize question ambiguity as much as possible, especially when
the introduction narrows the possible answers to just a few probable
answers (<EM>This Polish pianist...</EM>).

<H3>Bonus Questions</H3>

<H4>Difficulty</H4>

A good team should get 50%-70% of possible bonus points.<P>

<H4>Point Values</H4>

The total points available must be either 20, 25, or 30 points.  A bonus
may be subdivided into partial credit in multiples of 5 or 10 points.<P>

[<STRONG>Ed.</STRONG>: some invitationals will allow for bonus questions worth more than 30
points, but this is unusual and at the discretion of the host.]<P>

<H4>Question Themes</H4>

Eschew cuteness.  Pick a theme, either within one category, or a variety
of them.  Introduce the theme and ask the question(s).  Remember that the
question will be read in its entirety so it is not necessary to put more
obscure facts preceding more obvious facts (unless it is a multiple-part
question).<P>

<H4>Don't Reward Random Guessing</H4>

Avoid Binary questions (Yes/No, Higher/Lower, Before/After) since no one
should be able to get 50% of the points with no knowledge whatsoever.
Similarly, questions that involve ordering a list or matching two lists
tend to reward guessing and luck rather than actual knowledge.  If you use
this format, please use it sparingly.<P>

In general, if a question doesn't call for recall of specific information,
or if a team could get the answer with no knowledge of the area
whatsoever, then the question doesn't belong in a match situation.<P>

<H3>Bonus Formats</H3>

<H4>One Part, One Answer</H4>
These are difficult questions scored all-or-nothing.  Each is worth twenty,
twenty-five, or thirty points depending upon its difficulty.<P>

Example:<P>
<PRE>
25 POINT BONUS
One of the last giants of Abstract Expressionism, this painter of
_Elegies to the Spanish Republic_ died July 17, 1991 on Cape Cod. For
25 points, name him.
ANSWER: ROBERT _MOTHERWELL_
</PRE>
<DT>
<H4>Multiple Parts Related by a Common Theme</H4>

The parts of the question should be of varying difficulty to insure a
partial score but make a perfect score difficult to realize.  There should
be no more than three parts as each part can take 10-15 seconds of game
time to read and answer.  If the questions are exceedingly short and easy,
one might use four five-point parts.<P>
Example:<P>

<PRE>
30 POINT BONUS
Name, for ten points each, the following members of the Emergency Committee
on State Security, given their pre-coup positions:
1. Interior Minister
ANSWER: BORIS K. _PUGO_
2.  KGB Chief
ANSWER: VLADIMIR A. _KRYUCHKOV_ (KROOSH-KOV)
3.  Vice-President
ANSWER: GENNADI _YANAYEV_
</PRE><P>

<H4>One Question, Multiple Answers</H4>

You ask for a list of things, and give points for each correct answer.  Be
sure to specify clearly the number of items for which you are looking,
especially if the question will accept any three of the four.  Asking
teams to generate long lists with many possible answers ("Name any six
OPEC nations", or "Name 8 Common Market Nations for 15 points, 9 for 20
points...," for example) tends to be difficult to moderate and should be
avoided.  A precise and manageable list should be used.<P>
Example:<P>

<PRE>
25 POINT BONUS
Only 5 major league pitchers have ever thrown more than 45 consecutive
scoreless innings. For 5 points apiece, name them.
ANSWERS: CARL _HUBBEL_, _BOB GIBSON_, _WALTER JOHNSON_, DON _DRYSDALE_,
	 OREL _HERSHISER_
</PRE><P>

In some cases, an incorrect answer ends the bonus.  In this case, which
should not be overused, include the phrase "but be careful, a miss will
stop you" in the question.<P>

<H4>Progressive (30-20-10) Questions</H4>

These questions are asked in three parts.  Each part is an additional clue
to the same answer.  The general category is always given in the original
question.<P>
Example:<P>

<PRE>
30 POINT BONUS
Identify this person after the first clue to earn 30 points, after two
clues for twenty points, or after all three clues for ten points:
30. He was elected to Congress in 1978 to fill the seat vacated by
    Barbara Jordan.
20. He founded and chaired the House Select Committee on World Hunger, and
    twice served as Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.
10. He died in an airplane crash en route to a refugee camp in Ethiopia
    in 1989.
