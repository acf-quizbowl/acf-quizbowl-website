In preparation for the move to online tournaments during the COVID-19 pandemic, ACF members developed a training (in collaboration with other community members) for prospective moderators to learn how to moderate online tournaments. The training is required for all staffers who wish to moderate at ACF tournaments, and may be found [at this link](http://minkowski.space/quizbowl/training/online-moderator/).
