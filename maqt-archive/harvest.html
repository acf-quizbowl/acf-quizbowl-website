Brian,

I don't quite know.

Okay.

Okay. You'll probably get them in late November.

Thanks. :)

I recall putting 4 science questions in each first half packet -- and three
such questions in each second half packet. A number of them were history of
science, but there were science questions in there.

OK, these problems come up with any tournament.

All tournaments are going to have their questions that are (1) too hard,
(2) too easy, (3) really weird, etc. What's so wrong with that?

Whoops! :)

Haven't you ever panicked before? That's exactly what I did.

Hans Krimm (the man from H-SC) said the exact same thing.

You are not the first person to recognize that my ego exceeds my abilities 
many times. You're telling me nothing my teammates have not already.

You are correct, sir.

You got (1) a free lunch and (2) 8 out of 14 games. In addition, you 
will be getting 16 packets (9-10 of which have never been played). 
The questions themselves are about $10, and by your own admission, they 
weren't that bad. 

And if the Lord's kicking my ass, what concern is it to you? :)

I don't blame them. That is their choice.

However, I would not like to penalize my successors for my mistakes and 
fuckups.

What does this mean? That R-MC should just crawl into their collective hole
and never be heard from again in the world of academic competition? I think 
not! 

If we quit now, then we did fail, and we're going to be a joke _forever_. If
we keep trying, then we can redeem ourselves. 

<h1>The problem revolved mainly around the fact that we didn't write 
enough questions. Other than that, what was _so_ wrong? </h1>We gave you lunch, the
officials were inexperienced (but hey, we've only been doing this for a 
semester), so you could only expect so much. We were even able to switch
buildings quickly, several teams were late (hence making the tournament late),

So if we get each team to submit a packet (again, this is a standard practice),
why would you think that R-MC could never hold a decent tournament?

You'll get a prize. :)

Take care now. We hope to see you at Wahoo War and intervening tournaments.

Since you did get 8 of 14 games, and you sent two teams, I think it is 
perfectly fair to allow us to send a team for free. We will pay the standard
fee for our second team. If you don't think this is fair, then let me know
as soon as possible, as then we will probably not be sending any teams. Your 
loss, again, unless you have to turn teams away (and that didn't happen last 
year.)

	Then, of course, we left.

</pre>
<P>
Team B, consisiting of Jamie Plummer, Daniel Hodes and Anthony Airne did not keep such meticulous numbers. 
Team B went 1-4 before they decided Ruby Tuesday's provided more intellectual stimulation than Harvest Bowl.
