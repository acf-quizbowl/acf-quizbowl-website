</CENTER>

Alas, all neologisms are not created equally, and some fade into disuse.
To keep the lexicon fresh, archaic terms have been removed and placed
here for posterity.

A player who is absolutely 100% "gair-awn-teed" to lose in a competitive endeavor.  Usage: "Dude -- 
you're just so much
assmeat."  [etymology -- probably derived from "Meat," which was the name written on a
scoreboard at CBI Nationals for a team playing against Virginia.  The ubiquitous prefix "ass-"
was somehow added, and the meaning was changed.  See <A 
HREF="lexicon.html#assluck">assluck</A>
for another instance of this prefix.]<P>
