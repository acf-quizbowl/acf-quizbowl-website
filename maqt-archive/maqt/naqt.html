</CENTER>

The University of Maryland-College Park is pleased to host the
Mid-Atlantic Sectional for National Academic Quiz Tournaments.  The 
tournament will take place on Friday evening and Saturday, November
15-16, 1996.<P>

NAQT was created by a group of tournament veterans with the aim of
providing quality questions at a low cost.  The format, question
difficulty, and question distribution will all follow the guidelines of
the Penn Bowl/Michigan MLK Tournaments.  Each game will consist of two
9-minute halves.  Questions will be drawn from mostly academic subjects
(history, literature, science, etc.), though non-academic subjects such as
current events, pop culture, and sports will also be represented.  For
more information about NAQT see the 
<A HREF="http://www.naqt.com">NAQT web site</A> or send email to
<A HREF="mailto:naqt@naqt.com">naqt@naqt.com</A>.<P>

To register for NAQT Regionals at Maryland, contact Lord High Tournament
Director Jesse Molesworth via email at: 
<A HREF="mailto:potemkin@wam.umd.edu">potemkin@wam.umd.edu</A> or via
telephone at (301) 314-0207.  The last day to register for this tournament
is November 9.<P>

The tournament fees will be the following:<P>

<PRE>$70 base fee
-$10 for bringing a working buzzer system
-$10 for bringing a working clock
-$20 for teams who have competed in two or fewer tournaments within the
past year (ACU-I events excluded)</PRE><P>

Question sets will be available after the tournament for the price of
$25.<P>

A preliminary cap of 30 teams has been set.  However, if there is 
sufficient interest, we will expand the tournament as resources permit.
Priority will be given initially to first teams from each college or
university.  The exact tournament format will be determined by the size of
the field; however, each team can expect to play at least 15 round-robin 
matches.  If brackets are necessary, a round-robin playoff (similar to ACF
Nationals) will be used.<P>
