## Bid Acceptance
1. All teams that qualify via A-Value or autobid must inform ACF of the acceptance of their bid by **February 15, 2020**. Bid responses should be submitted using the [ACF bid response form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9tkD2C6UsNZlkLu41AXalOEU05OFNRzxuAeTedlXNN8Z3Zg/viewform).

2. If the field does not fill once the bid acceptance deadline is reached, then all available bids will be awarded in order of descending A-value.

## Waitlist
1. Teams that have not received a bid to ACF Nationals are invited to sign up for the waitlist. The deadline to sign up for the ACF Nationals waitlist is **February 15, 2020**. To sign up for the waitlist, please fill out the [ACF bid response form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9tkD2C6UsNZlkLu41AXalOEU05OFNRzxuAeTedlXNN8Z3Zg/viewform), entering "Other" for your team name and entering your team name in the waitlist team name field.

2. If a team declines a bid, that bid will be offered to the teams on the waitlist, in order of descending A-Value.

## Standby

1. ACF is also looking for teams willing to serve as standby teams in case of last-minute drops. Standby teams must commit to showing up to the tournament day-of; if there are any open spots, they will be able to play ACF Nationals for no entry fee. Otherwise, they are free to staff or explore the Twin Cities.

2. To sign up as a standby team, please email Tournament Director Ryan Rosenberg at [td@acf-quizbowl.com](mailto:td@acf-quizbowl.com).
