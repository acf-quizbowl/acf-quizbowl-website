# Pseudonyms
Teams at ACF tournaments may consist of individuals from only one school or institution (see [eligibility rules](/eligibility-rules)) and, in general, must use the name of that school or institution. Teams may use pseudonyms in unusual legitimate circumstances only. Team pseudonyms must first be approved by ACF’s Site Coordinator and the TD of the tournament. Pseudonyms must be appropriate and neutral in tone (e.g. “\[City] Scholars”) and may not be offensive or confusing. Pseudonyms must be clearly indicated (e.g. within quotation marks) in all official team lists, including schedules and statistics reports.

ACF reserves the right to reveal the affiliation of pseudonymous teams at its discretion.
ACF also reserves the right to deny or alter a team’s choice of pseudonym for any reason.

Individual players must use (1) their legal name, (2) a preferred name that they use regularly, or a clear nickname or variant of either (1) or (2).
Individual players may not use pseudonyms to obscure their identity or impersonate others.

# Player bans and public reporting
ACF's [Gameplay Rules](/gameplay-rules/#i-ethics-and-conduct) define two types of misconduct that can lead to a ban: **minor misconduct** and **major misconduct**. This document provides examples of both types of misconduct, explains ACF’s player ban policies for each type, and describes circumstances under which a player ban will be reported to the community. Note that misconduct occurring outside an ACF-sponsored activity may still result in an ACF ban.

## Minor misconduct
* Examples of minor misconduct include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, disorderly conduct during match play, intimidation of game or tournament officials, and verbal harassment.
* First instances of minor misconduct result in a warning from ACF. 
* Repeated instances of minor misconduct result in bans of one year or more.

## Major misconduct
* Examples of major misconduct include, but are not limited to: cheating or conspiring to cheat at a quizbowl tournament, violent conduct during a tournament, sexual harassment, and sexual assault.
* First instances of major misconduct result in bans of one year or more. 
* Repeated or extreme instances of major misconduct result in permanent bans.
* Players may appeal permanent bans that have been in place for one year. 

## Inactive or ineligible players
* ACF generally does not ban players who are not yet in college. However, major misconduct by older high school players may result in bans.
* Ineligible players may receive delayed bans. These bans will only begin if the player later becomes eligible to play ACF tournaments.
* ACF may not necessarily initiate ban proceedings for players who are inactive or have lost eligibility.

## Ban reporting
* Bans will be announced in the “Misconduct Issues” subforum of the Quizbowl Resource Center Forums, which requires an account to view.
* Announcements will include the duration of the ban and the broad category of misconduct (cheating, interpersonal misconduct, other). 
* Announcements will **not** identify the reporter or any additional details of the misconduct unless specifically requested by the reporter. 
* ACF will announce player bans as a general policy, but will make exceptions in unusual circumstances, including at the request of the reporter. Reporters who wish to pursue an unreported player ban should discuss the situation with the ACF representative who contacts them about their report.
* Warnings given for first instances of minor misconduct will not be reported.
* Time-limited bans that have expired will not be reported.
