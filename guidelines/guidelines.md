This page contains a list of all guidelines used by ACF for running its tournaments.

## Hosting

Hosts of ACF tournaments should refer to our:

* [Hosting guidelines](hosting)
* [List of approved formats](formats) for designing a schedule
* [Statistics guide](stats) that standardizes best practices for tournament stats entry

Reach out to the [ACF Site Coordinator](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com) if you have any questions.

## Packet Submission

If your team is submitting a packet to one of ACFâ€™s tournaments, refer to the [packet submission guidelines](packet-sub).

For an explanation of the philosophy behind ACF packet submission, ACF emeritus member Matthew Jackson wrote an explanation of [why packet submission matters](/writing/why-packet-sub).
