## Hosting
Hosts of ACF tournaments should refer to our:

- [hosting guidelines](/hosting-guidelines)
- [list of approved formats](/formats) for designing a schedule
- [statistics guide](/stats-guide) designed to standardize best practices for tournament stats entry

Reach out to the [ACF Site Coordinator](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com) if you have any questions.

## Packet submission
If your team is submitting a packet to one of ACF’s tournaments, refer to the [packet submission guidelines](/packet-submission-guidelines/).

For an explanation of the philosophy behind ACF packet submission, ACF emeritus member Matthew Jackson wrote an explanation of [why packet submission matters](/why-packet-submission).

## Writing questions
ACF member Jerry Vinokurov’s [guide to writing questions](/jerry-guide/) is helpful for new -- and old! -- writers.
