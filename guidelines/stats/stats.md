## Keeping Stats

### Software

#### MODAQ

[MODAQ](https://github.com/alopezlago/MODAQ), developed by Alejandro Lopez-Lago, is a free web application for assisting moderators with reading and scorekeeping quiz bowl matches. It automatically calculates scores while simultaneously tracking buzzpoint data.

To use MODAQ, visit either of the following URLs:

* [https://www.quizbowlreader.com/demo.html](https://www.quizbowlreader.com/demo.html)
* [https://modaq.github.io/](https://modaq.github.io/)

For a guide to using MODAQ, see the [MODAQ Wiki](https://github.com/alopezlago/MODAQ/wiki).

#### YellowFruit

[YellowFruit](https://github.com/anadig/YellowFruit/) is a free statkeeping application developed by Andrew Nadig. It works well in tandem with MODAQ, as QBJ files exported by [MODAQ](#modaq) can be imported into YellowFruit easily. For more information and discussion, see the thread about YellowFruit on the HSQB forums.

To use YellowFruit, download [the latest release](https://github.com/ANadig/YellowFruit/releases/latest) from [its GitHub page](https://github.com/ANadig/YellowFruit).

#### SQBS

[SQBS](https://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/) is a free statkeeping application developed by Stanford University quizbowlers.

### Best Practices

#### Team and Player Names

* Always use players’ full first and last names.
* After both player and school names, indicate "(DII)" or "(UG)" as applicable, even if there are not enough Division II and/or Undergraduate schools to award trophies (e.g. “Jane Doe (DII)” or “Michigan State (UG)”).
  * For Division II players, it is not necessary to indicate both DII and UG.

### Miscellaneous

* Enter the packet names exactly as they appear in the file name (`Settings → Packet Names`).
* Enable round reports (`Settings → General → Include Round Reports`).

## Managing Stats

### [Quizbowl Resource Center Database](https://hsquizbowl.org/db)

* The tournament listing on the [Collegiate Announcements subforum](https://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=8) should be formatted as `[Year] ACF [Tournament] at [School]`, e.g. `2019 ACF Regionals at Toronto`.
* To create a database entry on the [Quizbowl Resource Center Database](https://hsquizbowl.org/db/) for a tournament:
  * Sign in to your forums account.
  * Click `Add a tournament` at the top right corner.
  * Fill out all entries in the form and link the tournament listing as the `Forum post URL`.
* To upload statistics for an existing database entry:
  * Sign in to your forums account.
  * Click your username at the top right hand corner.
  * Select the tournament.
  * Click `Edit tournament listing`.
  * Click `Manage stat reports`.
  * Click `Add stat report`.
  * Follow the directions and upload the HTML files generated by YellowFruit or SQBS.
* Note that only the owner of a database entry may post statistics for it. To transfer the ownership of a tournament to someone else:
  * Go to the database entry for the tournament.
  * Click `Edit tournament listing`.
  * Click `Change owner`.

### Multi-Phase Tournaments

* If the tournament uses multiple preliminary pools, label them separately as divisions (File → New Tournament → Use Divisions)
* If tournament uses multiple phases like preliminary rounds and playoff games, statistics should be posted for each phase separately, as well as a combined file for all phases. `Settings → General → Rounds Included In Reports`, then generate separate reports.
* When breaking ties, it may be necessary to seed teams by points per game, only including games against opponents that both teams played (see ACF’s [Formats](/guidelines/formats) guidelines). After saving a safe copy of the tournament results, delete non-common games for the teams involved in the tiebreaker.
  * Deleting a game cannot be undone, so exercise care!
