This page lists full-packet distributions for each ACF tournament. Teams submitting full packets to ACF tournaments should follow the prescribed distribution for the tournament they are submitting a packet to.

For tournaments with half-packet submissions, teams will only submit a half-packet of 12/12. Teams that request to submit a half-packet will be given a half-packet submission template containing a list of pre-assigned categories.

> [!NOTE]
> The notation “X/Y” refers to X tossups and Y bonuses (per packet).
