> The notation “X/Y” refers to X tossups and Y bonuses (per packet).

This page lists the distribution for a **full packet (24/24)** for each ACF tournament. Teams submitting a full packet to an ACF tournament should see the column of the distribution table corresponding to that tournament.

ACF tournaments may *also* or *instead* provide the option for submission of a **half-packet (12/12)** or a **quarter packet (7/7)** instead of a full packet. The half- and quarter packet distribution template, as assigned by the tournament head editor on a team-by-team basis, will be a unique subset of the categories that comprise the full packet distribution.

## Distribution Table

> [!NOTE]
> In total, the full-packet distribution is 24/24, even though the edited packets are 20/20. To produce an edited packet from a given submission, the editors will remove 1/1 Literature, 1/1 History, 1/1 Science, and 1/1 Other.
